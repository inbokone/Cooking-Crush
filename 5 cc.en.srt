6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,510
Thank you, Chef, for being my happiness.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,410
Actually, I have good feelings for you too.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,540
But…if you also have good feelings for me, I wouldn't mind that at all.

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,120
I don’t know what’s wrong with Jane. She hasn’t texted me back either.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,770
You may see me as your stalker.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,770
You know it’s wrong, why do you still do it?

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,140
Because I really like you.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,190
To find a new team champion of three members

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,540
to compete for a prize worth three million baht.

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,560
Three million!

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,600
Everything I said is factual.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,690
You're going to lose to us in the competition.

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,410
If you choose not to join, we'll just keep teasing you like this.

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,660
Have you decided on the dish you’d like me to teach you this Saturday?

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,020
I’m actually busy that day.

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,130
Hurry up, Pang.

22
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,500
If it weren't for Moo Ping, I wouldn't have woken up this early.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,250
I'm so sleepy.

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,370
Here.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,610
Isn’t that Dr. Ten? He looks quite nice today.

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,090
Why don’t you go talk to him?

27
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,090
Let’s head back. Grandma is waiting.

28
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,310
So? What about “Let’s head back. Grandma is waiting.”?

29
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,660
Keep it down. He might hear you.

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,170
He’s miles away. He can’t hear us.

31
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,060
What’s holding you back? Why don’t you go and talk to him?

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,530
“Why no cooking class? Have you had plans with someone else?”

33
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,000
Nah. That’ll make me look too nosy.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,410
And what we are doing right now isn’t nosy at all?

35
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,410
Just ask him if you’re curious.

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,870
Look. He’s buying some flowers.

37
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,220
Hurry and text him.

38
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,550

39
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,340

40
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,460

41
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,180
Fine.

42
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,480

44
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,090

45
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,850

[I already have plans today.]

47
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,840
Ask him what his plans are?

48
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,490
That bouquet is huge. I don’t think we need to ask.

49
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,430
Maybe he’s meeting a friend.

50
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,760
Friends also give flower bouquets to each other.

51
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,490
Let’s just head back.

52
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,040
You almost cut your fingers there.

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,520
Ouch.

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,340
Look. I lost my fingers.

55
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,990
Haha, funny. That’s fake. You can’t fool me.

56
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,620
We have customers.

57
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,100
Take care of them.

58
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,030
I’m gonna take a nap.

59
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,470
You’ll be alright, right?

60
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
Hello, Chef.

61
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,730
Doc.

62
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,720
The entire order is on the table.

63
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,580
It’s her birthday today.

64
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,530
I thought it'd be nice to bring her here.

65
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,280
She used to bring me here when I was little,

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,660
saying it was her favorite place to eat.

67
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,460
And I just realized this is your place.

68
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,250
She’s actually my mother.

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,340
Your mother?

70
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,760
Here you go, Mr. Ten.

71
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,060
Thank you, Mai.

72
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,270
I thought you wanted to cook this for yourself.

73
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,460
I have someone whom I want to try this.

74
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,500
After we finished cooking today,

75
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,950
I thought he would dig in right away.

76
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,010
Turns out, he saved it for his girlfriend.

77
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,840
How do you know he cooked it for his girlfriend?

78
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,860
I saw his girlfriend's picture on his post.

79
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,330
So she’s your mother.

80
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,250
I'm bringing her photo along to make it seem like I'm taking her

81
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,420
to the restaurant she liked.

82
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,910
I apologize

83
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,350
if this seems a bit unusual.

84
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,150
Not at all, Doc.

85
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,180
My grandmother eats with her late husband every day.

86
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,950
Look. Just as we were talking about…

87
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,630
Well then, please enjoy the meal. I won’t bother you now.

88
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,650
Alright.

89
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,110
It must taste really good.

90
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,650

91
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,150
One, two…

92
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,490
You look very handsome.

93
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,950
This is your mom’s favorite restaurant.

94
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,150
Eat up, son. It’s her birthday today.

95
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,910
Okay.

96
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,560

DISH 5
I’D LIKE TO MAKE DEEP-FRIED SHRIMP CAKES WITH YOU, CHEF

108
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,530
It was such a good meal, Chef.

109
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,830
I’m glad that you enjoyed it.

110
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:23,280
It would have been better if my mom were here.

111
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,740
She fell sick when I was 15 years old.

112
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,950
The first sign was just her chronic coughing.

113
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,600
I didn’t suspect anything at first.

114
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,230
I just thought it was due to a swift change in weather conditions.

115
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,640
Besides, he's a doctor;

116
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,020
he should have known her symptoms best.

117
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,820
He?

118
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,780
My father.

119
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Her cough became more severe.

120
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,560
Before we understood what her symptoms meant, it was too late.

121
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Are you okay, Mom?

122
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,580
I’m fine.

123
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,360
He was always busy with his work,

124
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,290
never had time to take care of me or my mother.

125
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,670
Eventually, she passed away.

126
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,280
He's the reason I aimed for med school.

127
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,500
I want to become a better doctor than he is.

128
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,020
I'll do my best to care for and heal my patients.

129
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,690
I don't want anyone to endure what I have.

130
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,400
However, I'm not sure…

131
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,510
if I can do it.

132
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,130
You can do it.

133
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,900
From what I see,

134
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,840
you’re dedicated,

135
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,580
a quick learner,

136
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,580
and detail-oriented.

137
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,450
When I taught you to cook,

138
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,750
you remembered everything after just one instruction.

139
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,550
Your approach to your med studies is likely to be similar.

140
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,970
I’m sure you’re becoming a great doctor.

141
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,670
Thank you, Chef.

142
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,010
You are on your way to being a great chef too

143
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,210
because your food is incredibly delicious.

144
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,740
Are you saying that just to cheer me up?

145
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,300
I genuinely mean it.

146
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:44,850
Your food not only fills my stomach but also warms my heart.

147
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,910
I’m truly happy to have your food.

148
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,310
You can see me off from here.

149
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:11,800
Your food not only fills my stomach but also warms my heart.

150
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,200
I’m truly happy to have your food.

151
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,540
You guys, I’ve decided to participate in Super Monster Chef!

152
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,220

153
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,750
[I’m back home. I’m actually pondering over the dish I’d like to learn next Sat.]

154
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,640
What’s up, Doc?

155
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,580
(I still can’t decide what I want to learn yet.)

156
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,610
Yeah, I was going to ask you about our cooking session this Saturday.

157
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,900
Should I come over to your place like we did before?

158
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,550
Oh my, are you cooking?

159
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,900
I thought the maid was preparing something.

160
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,670
Wow, this steamed egg looks really good.

161
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,730
I'm not sure if that woman will be at home or not.

162
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,720
After my mother passed away,

163
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,700
he had a new partner whom you met.

164
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,520
Ah, I see. You don’t really like having her around, do you?

165
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,510
Remember when I mentioned I didn’t like physical contact?

166
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,020
Part of that was because of her.

167
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,460
What do you mean?

168
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,910
I feel like she's somewhat invasive.

169
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,360
But she’s your father’s partner, right?

170
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,320
I might be overthinking things.

171
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,440
I'll let you know again where we should cook.

172
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,140
Doc, I think we can cook at your place as usual.

173
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,300
I’ll figure out a way to help you.

[Deep-fried Shrimp Cake Recipe]

175
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,440
Here, go ahead and wash them.

176
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,490
Alright.

177
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,110
Wow, what are you doing in the kitchen?

178
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,900
Oh, you’re…

179
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,830
Prem.

180
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,800
Ah, yes. I remember now.

181
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,590
We met when…

182
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,840
you taught him to cook steamed egg…

183
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,970
Oops!

184
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,470
It slipped.

185
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,930
Oh my.

186
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,420
Let’s learn how to cook this.

187
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,130
But first, you need to put on an apron.

188
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,130
Wait, let me help.

189
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,140
Come here.

190
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,710
Closer.

191
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,370
He's really taking good care of you.

192
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,310
Doc, to achieve the firm and chewy texture,

193
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,310
you’ll need to mix swiftly and toss them into the bowl forcefully.

194
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,450
If you have any anger toward someone, now is the time to let it out.

195
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,250
Okay, Chef!

196
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,180
Overly…

197
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,900
nosy!

198
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,600
Overbearing!

199
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,940
None of…

200
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,660
your business!

201
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,220
Being sweet?

202
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,730
I want to puke!

203
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,490
Excuse me.

204
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,100
Is Ten mad at someone?

205
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,740
Not me, I’m sure.

206
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,610
Since I met him, we’ve never been mad at each other.

207
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,810
We get along so well.

208
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,320
He’s very kind to me.

209
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,990
Are you…

210
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,540
Don’t tell me…

211
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,480
Ten and you…

212
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,880
Alright,

213
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,680
we’re not gonna tell you.

214
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,610
Doc,

215
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,900
could you taste this dipping sauce and tell me if it’s good already?

216
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,300
Here you go.

217
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,140
On your hand?

218
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,280
Yes.

219
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,310
Here.

220
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,410
Okay, okay.

221
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,490
Oh my goodness.

222
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,310
Sweet!

223
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,040
It’s really good, Chef.

224
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,790
Then it’s ready to go.

225
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,500
See?

226
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,830
Excuse me.

227
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,160
Doc,

228
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,760
it’s reward time for being a good student.

229
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,530
but your hands are messy, I’ll help feed you.

230
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,810
Thanks.

231
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,260
Here.

232
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,400
Do you feel better now?

233
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,780
Not yet.

234
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,630
Have some more then.

235
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,110
I think I should go have a shower.

236
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,120
I feel very hot now.

237
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,660
Wow, Doc.

238
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
You fried them really well.

239
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,020
You've done an impressive job making them look this good on your first try.

240
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,770
Well, I learned from the best.

241
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,750
Do you want to take a picture with these Shrimp Cakes?

242
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,360
I’ll take it for you.

243
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,490
How?

244
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,370
Like this.

245
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,330
Like this.

246
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,700
Then we should take a picture together.

247
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,960
Ah, sure.

248
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,920
Come closer.

249
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,690
Closer.

250
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,830
A bit more.

251
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,140
One more time.

252
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,280
One, two, three.

253
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,900
Okay.

254
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,650
Don’t forget to send these pictures to me.

255
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,780
Sure.

256
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,560
Uh, I wanted to ask you this.

257
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,790
Did I go too far? I had my hands on you like that.

258
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,790
Did I make you feel uncomfortable?

259
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,830
Not at all. It actually feels good.

260
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,120
Well then, let’s try this.

261
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,500
Here.

262
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,860
Doc!

263
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,440
Is it so good that you almost want to eat the fork too?

264
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,260
Yes.

265
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,590
Well, do you like…

266
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,820
I do…

267
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
It’s really tasty.

268
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,940
I’m happy that you like it.

269
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,670
You’re home, hon?

270
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,370
Oh, you brought work from the hospital home too?

271
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,830
Your drink.

272
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,250
Thanks.

273
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,060
There’s a new budget for medical equipment that I need to finish quickly.

274
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,310
But you need to have some rest too.

275
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:26,940
You seem stressed and have been coming home late often lately.

276
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,940
There’s something else too.

277
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,520
Anyway, you spend more time at home than me.

278
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,780
Have you seen Ten get some new stuff?

279
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,770
Why?

280
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:47,830
My credit card got charged 300,000 baht in less than a week.

281
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,200
Really, hon?

282
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,570
300K?

283
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,200
Woah.

284
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,170
Hon, could it be that Ten got duped by a Call Center scammer?

285
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,150
Or...

286
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,330
And who’s this? Your friend?

287
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,260
Hello. Nice to meet you.

288
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,020
Nice to meet you too. 	What’s your name?

289
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:10,960
It’s Prem.

290
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,590
Since I met him, we’ve never been mad at each other.

291
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,890
We get along so well.

292
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,890
He’s very kind to me.

293
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,350
What’s on your mind?

294
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,430
Ah, Ten has been getting into learning to cook lately.

295
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,560
Today, he even tried making a dish at home.

296
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,620
Ten is learning how to cook?

297
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,680
Yes.

298
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,080
With which chef?

299
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,410
Not exactly a professional chef, I think.

300
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,940
He's probably learning with his college friend named Prem.

301
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,810
They seem really close.

302
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,810
They actually are lovely together.

303
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:55,150
Could Prem be trying to scam money out of Ten?

304
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,740
Is that even possible?

305
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,980
Prem doesn't strike me as that kind of person.

306
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,930
Still, 300K for cooking lessons?

307
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:12,510
Shouldn’t he pay that to a renowned culinary school instead?

308
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,890
[I’m already home, Doc.]

309
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:27,520
[Okay, good. But you haven’t sent all the pictures of us with Shrimp Cakes yet.]

310
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,660
[Really? I thought I sent all of them.]

311
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:37,630
[The selfie of you alone, you haven’t sent that over.]

312
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,620
Hello.

313
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,250
(Is this Prem’s number? I’m Ten’s father.)

314
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,310
You live here?

315
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,530
Yes. I’m the grandchild of this place’s owner.

316
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,740
There it is.

317
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,320
Wow, what’s that?

318
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,240
This is Fried Pork Toast.

319
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,620
Please try it. It’s delicious.

320
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,300
Ah, you’re that boy.

321
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,350
Is there anything I can help you with?

322
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,010
I heard that you’re teaching Ten to cook.

323
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,000
And there’s nothing wrong with learning how to cook.

324
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,530
It’s a hobby.

325
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,810
I understand that.

326
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,320
But as far as I know, you didn’t teach him any fancy dishes.

327
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,260
Am I right?

328
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,720
Yes.

329
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,490
Okay,

330
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,110
that means the fee shouldn’t be as high as six digits.

331
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,520
If it’s that high, it should be for international dishes

332
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,100
with a curriculum and certifications.

333
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,700
But Ten paid several hundred thousand for it.

334
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,920
But don’t get me wrong yet.

335
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,050
I’m not here to reclaim the money.

336
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,840
I’m not that kind of person.

337
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,740
My issue is to tell you that

338
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:28,630
at this moment, I suspect you might be trying to scam my son.

339
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,870
It wasn’t my intention to do so.

340
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,040
I only wanted to earn enough for my sister’s tuition fee.

341
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,380
Alright, calm down.

342
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,380
Let me finish.

343
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,880
I don’t care about your reasons.

344
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,260
You can use the money for whatever purposes, it doesn’t concern me.

345
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,190
Just…

346
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:56,090
don’t use your pitiful situation to get money from Ten.

347
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,020
It’s not going to work.

348
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,450
I…apologize.

349
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,430
I will find money and pay Ten back, every bit of it.

350
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,720
You can keep it.

351
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,960
Money isn’t a problem for my family.

352
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,680
If you pay him back,

353
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,410
Ten would wonder why.

354
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,660
Me talking to you right here today

355
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,590
is to let you know that I don’t appreciate this approach of yours.

356
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,750
But if you genuinely want to take responsibility,

357
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,200
all I ask from you is to

358
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,850
never come close to Ten again.

359
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,950
Understand?

360
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,850
Hm?

361
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:35,980
[Is everything okay? Why have you gone silent all of a sudden?]

362
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,040
(Yes, Chef?)

363
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,360
I suddenly had something to take care of.

364
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,230
You haven’t sent that picture to me yet.

365
00:27:54,090 --> 00:28:00,000
Ah, I…accidentally deleted it. Sorry.

366
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,480
Really?

367
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:10,280
It’s okay. I can take a new picture of you later.

368
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,090
Doc, I have to go now.

369
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,280
Okay.

370
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,030
I'll charge you 50,000 baht for my cooking course.

371
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,680
Deal. 50,000 it is.

372
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,380
Doc, watch it!

373
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,850
Actually, I have good feelings for you too.

374
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,450
But…if you also have good feelings for me, I wouldn't mind that at all.

375
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,000
Come closer.

376
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,990
[Delete Photo]

377
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,640
Chef.

378
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,700
Chef.

379
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,290
Chef.

380
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,530
Chef.

381
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,880
Doc,

382
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
what are you doing here?

383
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,570
You said you already deleted that picture,

384
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,570
so I’m here to take a new one.

385
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,950
Wait. And you ran here from where?

386
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,550
From home.

387
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,160
Can I take a picture of you, Chef?

388
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,200
Please smile.

389
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,560
Smile wider.

390
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,030
I got them.

391
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,310
Thank you, Chef.

392
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,770
That’s it?

393
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,610
That’s it.

394
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,610
Good night, Chef.

395
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,770
Bye-bye.

396
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Is he cute, Mom?

397
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,080
At this moment, I suspect you might be trying to scam my son.

398
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,640
I don’t care about your reasons.

399
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:26,110
Just…don’t use your pitiful situation to get money from Ten.

400
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,960
It’s not going to work.

401
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,510
I've been waiting for you for so long.

402
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,670
Doc!

403
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,480
I cooked something for you to try.

404
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,490
Soup?

405
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,840
It takes quite some time to prepare.

406
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,630
When did you wake up to cook this?

407
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,650
My usual wake-up time.

408
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,820
It must have been very hectic in the kitchen.

409
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,260
Not at all, Chef. I followed every single step of your instruction.

410
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,710
Ouch. Where’s the kitchen towel?

411
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,720
Kitchen towel!

412
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,610
It’s hot. It’s hot!!!

413
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,610
You can cook now.

414
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,300
You don’t need to learn from me anymore.

415
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,950
I’m not good at it yet.

416
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,900
I got so many wounds from cooking.

417
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,770
Look.

418
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,320
There’s a wound here.

419
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,860
And here.

420
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,430
Oi, it hurts.

421
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,710
So dramatic.

422
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,290
Didn’t you say it wasn’t hectic?

423
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,480
Well, I was just pretending to act all cool.

424
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,500
When you said you wouldn’t teach me anymore, I got shocked.

425
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,570
So I decided to tell you what really happened.

426
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,410
Is it delicious?

427
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,930
Flavor-wise, you’re better now.

428
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,360
You can cook.

429
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,350
You sound like you don’t want to teach me anymore.

430
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,710
No.

431
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:33,620
I’ll continue learning to cook then. I still have two dishes left.

432
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,270
How about learning one dish today?

433
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,880
I don’t have class in the afternoon.

434
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,180
You can pick the dish you want to teach me.

435
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,110
I’m fine with any dish and in any kitchen.

436
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,410
We can actually go to my place.

437
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,600
I’m not sure when my class finishes yet.

438
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,370
Really?

439
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,680
I’ll be waiting to hear from you then.

440
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,500
If you guys were in my shoes, what would you do?

441
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,900
Would you stop teaching him like his father told me to?

442
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,040
Absolutely not.

443
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,300
You haven’t done anything wrong.

444
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,930
Dr. Ten was willing to pay.

445
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,400
But the fee is indeed extraordinarily high.

446
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,070
Then stop teaching, but don’t stop seeing him.

447
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:17,920
Why?

448
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,760
His father told you not to use your pitiful situation to deceive Dr. Ten.

449
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,670
Tell me this.

450
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,670
Have you ever shed tears in front of him?

451
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,430
No.

452
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,900
Have you ever acted all pitiful??

453
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,650
No.

454
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,570
See?

455
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,910
You can still see him.

456
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,340
Wow.

457
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,080
You are going all out in your own way.

458
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,260
Keep your praises.

459
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,400
I’m thick-skinned.

460
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,860
When I think about it, it kinda makes sense.

461
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,960
You don’t have to see him just for the money.

462
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,420
You can go out because you genuinely like each other.

463
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,110
There's nothing wrong with that.

464
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,180
You’re right, Unky.

465
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,280
Ohhhhh.

466
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,080
What?

467
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,530
Unky said you could go out ‘cause you like each other.

468
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,530
You agreed to that.

469
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,910
No, I meant…

470
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,910
I meant to say I didn’t see him to get money from him.

471
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,430
Your excuse digs even deeper.

472
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,650
You did admit it.

473
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,980
True. True.

474
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,950
You like each other?

475
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,180
Sure you do. You admitted it yourself just now.

476
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,640
What are you drawing? A love letter?

477
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,440
He’s drawing a heart shape.

478
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,180
It’s a heart shape. He’s in love.

479
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,110
Hey, what the hell?

480
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:28,000
Today, we want to sit in the front row.

481
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,230
You three go sit in the back.

482
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,160
So many empty seats, why do we have to move?

483
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,890
Yeah.

484
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,660
You always sit in the back, don’t you?

485
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,420
Why now?

486
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,100
You suddenly have bad eyesight all of a sudden?

487
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,690
Today is important.

488
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:45,700
So those who are not important must go sit somewhere else.

489
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,110
Get up and move on your own.

490
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,220
We’re not gonna move.

491
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,980
Oh.

492
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,320
Fine.

493
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,670
What the hell is wrong with them?

494
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,010
Good morning, everybody.

495
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,140
Good morning.

496
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,620
Today, I have a special guest to teach in place of me.

497
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,330
Hello, everybody.

498
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,130
My name is Chang Ma.

499
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,370
I’m an alumnus of this faculty from the year class 11.

500
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,850
Hello.

501
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,410
Which year class are you in now?

502
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,650
17.

503
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,470
Year class 17?

504
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,900
My name is Prem.

505
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,460
I’m studying at the same faculty as yours.

506
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,800
You are my junior?

507
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,990
Which year class are you in?

508
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,740
Year class 17.

509
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,020
I’m in my third year.

510
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,050
Actually, I’ve been a fan of yours for so long.

511
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,030
Year class 17?

512
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,130
We’re close.

513
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,290
Listen, he even addressed me personally.

514
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,290
You saw that, right?

515
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,350
Okay, I’m gonna start by squeezing the sauce.

516
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,530
And now, our main hero–

517
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,500
the prawn.

518
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:58,810
The green sauce I squeezed earlier will keep the Kaprao sauce inside.

519
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,760
We’ll start the garnishings step.

520
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,630
Always remember, a good dish must have all the elements –

521
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,620
appearance, taste, smell, and texture.

522
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,070
There’s a saying that 'Eat with your eyes first.'

523
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,780
It means that the appealing and appetizing look of the food

524
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,860
can boost the levels of the Ghrelin hormone,

525
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,690
which is responsible for controlling appetite and fullness in your body.

526
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:28,150
And that's it.

527
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,410
I believe each of you here has fantastic cooking skills.

528
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,100
Today, I'll be sharing some plating techniques with you.

529
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,730
We can transform a simple-looking dish into a fine-dining masterpiece,

530
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,250
making it both delicious and visually stunning.

531
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,860
I've been doing all the talking for a bit now.

532
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,010
Let me ask you a simple question:

533
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:54,170
What are your cooking principles?

534
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,170
I can answer.

535
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,010
For me, it's all about using good ingredients and having great cooking skills.

536
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,800
A perfect 100.

537
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,790
Hold on. What’s your name again?

538
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,800
It’s Boon.

539
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,310
And he said Chang Ma is close to him. How come he forgot his name?

540
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,180
Close or claim to be close?

541
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:21,610
Well, your answer is actually correct.

542
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,130
However, it's not the answer that gets a perfect score of 100.

543
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,980
Because this isn’t a question with only one 100% correct answer.

544
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,560
I see.

545
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,950
Right in your face, 3Bs.

546
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:38,220
What about you, Prem?

547
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,070
What are your cooking principles, Prem?

548
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,890
He knows Prem's name.

549
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,720
When did he introduce himself to Chang Ma?

550
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,550
I only think of making those who eat my food feel happy.

551
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,770
Happy? Seriously?

552
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,380
That's an overly optimistic and vague response.

553
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,140
That’s actually the most important point, Prem.

554
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:06,510
When you cook and infuse your passion into the food for others,

555
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:11,370
the attention you give while cooking is the most important aspect.

556
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,760
Thank you, Prem.

557
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,590
That can’t be true.

558
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,810
Alright, today I'm not just here to teach you.

559
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,510
I have something important to share.

560
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,240
You all are familiar with the Super Monster Chef show, right?

561
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,090
Yes.

562
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,820
This year is the first time they're holding a team competition.

563
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:34,070
So, today I'm here to assess your cooking potential.

564
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,910
After this class,

565
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,250
I'd like you to prepare a dish you're most confident in.

566
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,760
Just one dish.

567
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:47,540
Apply all the techniques I've taught you today to your dish.

568
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,280
For the team that demonstrates the most potential,

569
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,410
I'll speak with the professor.

570
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,010
He'll provide further guidance

571
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,770
and help you record a video for the show's audition.

572
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,550
Sounds good?

573
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,850
Good!

574
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,800
Good.

575
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Very good.

576
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,230
Yes.

577
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,790
Alright, let’s take a 10-minute break.

578
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,390
We'll delve into more details afterward.

579
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,370
Okay.

580
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,670
You can take a look and take a picture of this.

581
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,030
The dish we are good at the most?

582
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:32,310
[I’m done for today. I’m going to see you at your faculty now.]

583
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,770
(He doesn’t answer.)

584
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,300
I’ll just go there.

585
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,820
When you're squeezing the sauce,

586
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,760
grip it gently and apply pressure gradually.

587
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,450
Look at that. He’s even holding Prem’s hands.

588
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,370
Shit.

589
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,510
Right in front of our eyes.

590
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,100
Good.

591
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,560
Very beautiful.

592
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:06,960
Wow.

593
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,150
That’s perfect.

594
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,840
Me talking to you right here today

595
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,420
is to let you know that I don’t appreciate this approach of yours.

596
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,430
But if you genuinely want to take responsibility,

597
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,590
all I ask from you is to

598
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,330
never come close to Ten again.

599
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:38,390
Next, we will use some flowers and leaves, only small ones,

600
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,730
and place them onto this.

601
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,080
Wow,

602
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,590
okay.

603
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,580
That’s done.

604
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,930
See? It’s simple.

605
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,900
It makes your food look delicious and appealing.

606
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,990
What’s up, pal?

607
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:18,430
What? You are taking Fire to broaden his horizons?

608
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,660
Where?

609
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,840
With whom? Expensive?

610
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,840
Okay.

611
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,910
But I’ve got a cooking session today.

612
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,340
I’ll catch up with you guys later.

613
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,200
I’m hanging up now. Okay.

614
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,860
I’m sorry. I didn’t see your message.

615
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,110
I just finished my class.

616
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,430
It’s alright.

617
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,400
I understand that you are interested into…

618
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,070
studies.

619
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,770
Then stop teaching, but don’t stop seeing him.

620
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,730
His father told you not to use your pitiful situation to deceive Dr. Ten.

621
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,530
Have you ever shed tears in front of him?

622
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:03,300
No.

623
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,970
When I think about it, it kinda makes sense.

624
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,080
You don’t have to see him just for the money.

625
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,600
You can go out because you genuinely like each other.

626
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,400
There's nothing wrong with that.

627
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,690
(I’ll do what Dy and Unky suggested.)

628
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,690
(I’ll give it a try.)

629
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,890
7 HOURS LATER.

630
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,050
Pull over.

631
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,830
What’s with you?

632
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,830
Why did you bring me here?

633
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,430
I saw that you look confused lately.

634
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:37,250
You are unsure about your preference, right?

635
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,720
How did you know?

636
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,860
Fire, you are my best friend.

637
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,750
I can tell with just a glance.

638
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,010
Figuring out whether you're into women or men is a real challenge.

639
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,970
Some people never question it themselves.

640
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:56,750
But in your case, I think you're in a confusing place.

641
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,810
You need to try things to find your answer.

642
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,480
That's why I brought you here to explore.

643
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,710
Choose what feels right for you.

644
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,240
No. I don’t want to.

645
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,740
I’m afraid of cops.

646
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,090
No, please.

647
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,090
It's still early in the night.

648
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,610
Cops aren't usually on duty yet.

649
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,190
We should also support sex workers, you know?

650
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:17,050
We should help it to become a legitimate occupation.

651
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:20,300
People in this line of work should earn and receive wellness support,

652
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,730
just like any other occupation.

653
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,660
Think about it, it's a win-win situation.

654
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,120
People with needs can fulfill them,

655
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,480
and it can also help reduce crimes and sexual assaults too.

656
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,780
Wait a minute.

657
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,160
When did you become an advocate for human rights?

658
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,010
Seriously.

659
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:38,070
I'm just expressing my thoughts.

660
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,770
Every occupation should have the same rights.

661
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,390
We have the power to make a change.

662
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,430
Thailand should change in our time.

663
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,510
Woah!

664
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,510
You've got me fired up!

665
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,470
Are you in?

666
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:56,180
Alright, count me in. Let's do this.

667
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,830
That's the spirit!

668
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:02,840
Choose what feels right for you. Follow your desire.

669
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,440
Hey, Metha.

670
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,390
Stop.

671
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,580
What’s up?

672
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,820
It’s Dynamite.

673
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:30,470
Yeah, it’s him. He’s with Samsee too.

674
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,670
Are they also…

675
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,610
Hello.

676
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,490
Hey, gray hair dude! What brings you here?

677
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,700
My car brought me. We’re just driving around.

678
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,520
What about you two? What's your business here?

679
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,160
Selling?

680
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,070
Sell what? No, I'm here to buy.

681
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,010
No shame!

682
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,250
So you’re customers for this service too.

683
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,830
7 MINUTES AFTER

684
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,530
Now it's just us, Firefy.

685
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,960
Let's be honest.

686
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,930
I know that this area has a variety of styles and genders.

687
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,860
But I haven’t tried one yet. I never imagined you'd dare too.

688
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,460
I don’t dare. I just…

689
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,880
Just what?

690
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,490
I just came here with Metha. Nothing else.

691
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,390
Nothing else? It must be something.

692
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,660
Ah…

693
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,860
Since I told you I like you, it made you feel uneasy, right?

694
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:57,160
Hey.

695
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,160
Don't look away.

696
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,750
Why do you want to look into my eyes?

697
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,280
Go away.

698
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,950
Gotcha.

699
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,820
If you feel the same way, just tell me.

700
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,620
I can see it in your eyes.

701
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,220
Don’t keep it to yourself.

702
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,220
Hey, you like me?

703
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,590
Do you like me?

704
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,820
What was that? Couldn’t hear.

705
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,670
You like me?

706
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:19,800
I…

707
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,560
don’t…

708
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,310
like…

709
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:21,970
you…

710
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,350
Period.

711
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,560
Is it clear now?

712
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,840
Okay.

713
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,840
You don’t like me. Fine.

714
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:06,060
24 HOURS AFTER THAT

715
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,210
I’m…

716
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:18,540
off then.

You took someone else’s recipe to teach him.

729
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,070
How could he not be jealous?

730
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,760
There won't be any difference when we eat it.

731
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,580
It’s not that you dislike his dish. You’re jealous of him.

732
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,300
Do you realize your own feelings now?

733
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,630
How do you feel about Dr. Ten?

734
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,510
Sometimes, people get carried away without even realizing it.
