Um.

7
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:25,807
I’m grateful for whatever brought you to me.

8
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:28,395
My friends want to practice as the competition is getting closer.

9
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,610
They don’t want to waste any more time.

10
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:31,105
What was that?

11
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:32,708
Recharging you.

12
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:34,708
So that you are up for the practice.

13
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:38,589
Don’t tell me you already knew those two are dating?

14
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:40,408
Just the two of you knew.

15
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:42,408
Am I not your friend?

16
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:44,207
Hello, everyone!

17
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:49,091
Welcome to Super Monster Chef Thailand.

18
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:51,542
Out of 200 teams across the country,

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,728
only 4 have made the cut.

20
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:59,434
Only one of them will claim the title of Super Monster Chef Thailand.

21
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:01,004
Who are they?

22
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:02,768
Here’s the first team–

23
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:05,976
Team Mise en Place.

24
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:07,607
I’m here to win

25
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:10,207
because I have never lost to anyone.

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,506
And the second team is

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,600
Team Outstanding.

28
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:19,408
And the third team is

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,211
Team Goji Berry Ngap.

30
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:26,810
And the last team is

31
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,979
Team The Three Must-Eat-eers.

32
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:34,309
What's going on with your team?

33
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:35,980
Do you still want to compete?

34
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:38,404
Why is your team down to just two members?

35
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:39,980
Where's the other one?

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,808
If your team doesn't have three members, as required,

37
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:47,402
it means automatic disqualification even before the competition begins.

38
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:48,635
I will start counting.

Doc!

46
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:13,680
I’m the third member of The Three Must-Eat-eers.

Unky!

59
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,253
Unky, open the door.

60
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:38,410
Open the door, please.

61
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:39,979
Let’s talk it out.

62
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,740
I’ll explain why I didn’t want anyone to know.

63
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,468
Save your damn lies, I don’t want to hear anything.

64
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:45,700
Please open the door, Unky.

65
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,202
Unky, open the door!

66
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:51,977
Unky! I’m sorry. Can you open the door?

67
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,970
[The Three Must-Eat-eers (3)]
[Prem: On my way there.]

68
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:34,709
What was that?

69
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,709
Recharging you.

70
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:38,730
So that you are up for the practice.

71
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:39,614
No more.

72
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,702
It’s a dead end between me and him.

73
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:45,982
Don’t tell me you already knew those two are dating?

74
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,983
Don’t be absurd, Unky. Didn’t you say you are mature?

75
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,711
Are you calling me absurd, Prem?

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,610
[I’m not going to join the competition. I’m done! I quit!]
[Samsee left the group.]

77
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,976
Unky, open the door!

78
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,290
[I’m not going to join the competition. I’m done! I quit!]
[Samsee left the group.]

79
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:15,703
- Unky!
- Shit.

80
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:16,903
He’s left the group.

81
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:19,506
Unky, open the door!

82
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:20,607
Unky.

83
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:21,804
Unky!

84
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,402
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to say that to you, Unky!

85
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:30,604
I think you should leave him alone for now.

86
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,305
He may need time to think and be with himself.

87
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:49,008
Prem, how long do you think Unky will stay mad at us?

88
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,602
Damn, my phone battery is dying.

89
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,244
The charger is in his room.

90
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:55,605
Is this the time to worry about your charger?

91
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:57,980
I’m sorry.

92
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,309
Excuse me, Doc.

93
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:01,608
I also worry about him.

94
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:04,105
I never thought he would be that furious.

95
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:06,205
Fy, it was you.

96
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,302
You were the damn cause of this.

97
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,651
Hey, mind your language.

98
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:12,906
What’s the problem?

99
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:15,280
Nothing, dear.

100
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,980
You’re looking for a charger?

101
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:19,108
I’ll lend you mine.

102
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,293
I don’t get it though.

103
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:25,007
Why is Unky mad at you?

104
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:27,205
You just didn’t tell them.

105
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,986
If you’re the last person in the group to find out that Unky is dating someone,

106
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,979
will you be mad?

107
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:35,980
Fair enough.

108
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,013
I think Samsee is probably mad

109
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,705
that I was in his personal area.

110
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,207
No, Doc.

111
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,402
Unky is mad at me for calling him absurd.

112
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,505
Damn, what should we do now, Doc?

113
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:53,976
Invite him back to the group?

114
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:55,601
You do it.

115
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:57,511
You do it; you live with him.

116
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,660
No, you do it. You’re older than me. He trusts you.

117
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:01,466
You do it; you’re closer to him.

118
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:01,979
You do it.

119
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:02,506
You do it.

120
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,133
You do it.

121
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:03,671
You do it.

122
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:04,660
You do it.

123
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,309
You do it.

124
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:05,912
You do it.

125
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:06,565
You invite him.

126
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,041
You invite him.

127
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,577
You do it.

128
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,170
You do it.

129
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:09,983
Stop!

130
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,413
If the invite gets turned down,

131
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:15,208
you all will be even more bummed.

132
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:17,008
Damn.

133
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,808
That’s true.

134
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:52,162
Forget about the sugar overdose!

135
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,980
Hey, what’re you up to?

136
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:13,706
Enjoying snacks?

137
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:15,706
Not riding a banana boat for sure.

138
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,075
Can’t you see what I am doing?

139
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:18,302
Don’t spill something stupid.

140
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,204
Woah.

141
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:22,801
Someone is being moody here.

142
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:26,714
Why are you here alone?

143
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,200
Where are your friends?

144
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,214
They all have ditched me to be with their boyfriends.

145
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:37,305
Why is that making you moody?

146
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:42,407
Them having boyfriends doesn’t make me moody.

147
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:45,007
I just don’t like that they kept it from me.

148
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:49,207
Dy and Fire are dating.

149
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:51,805
But when I was around, they pretended to have a fight.

150
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,914
What makes me mad the most is the fact that Prem also knew.

151
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,312
I was the only one left in the dark.

152
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:57,709
What do you think?

153
00:08:58,668 --> 00:08:59,977
Do they still see me as their friend?

154
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:02,402
So I left our chat group.

155
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,976
There, there.

156
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:07,625
Are you feeling being left out by them?

157
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:08,503
Hey!

158
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,506
Stop bugging me.

159
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,977
You gray-hair bastard.

160
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:15,979
Hey, this color is called charming gray.

161
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:18,906
Listen, old man.

162
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:21,977
You are not mad that they are seeing someone.

163
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:25,703
You are mad that they kept that from you.

164
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,976
But I don’t think they intentionally wanted it to be like this.

165
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:34,500
Perhaps, they couldn’t find the right time to let you know.

166
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:43,208
Actually,

167
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:48,601
I wasn’t mad that they had a secret.

168
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,608
I’m just scared that they will actually leave me one day.

169
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:56,908
Leaving you?

170
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:00,099
Because of dating?

171
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:02,361
Friends and lovers are two different parts in people’s lives.

172
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:03,376
I know that.

173
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,407
But I’m not someone with many friends.

174
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:08,700
I’ve been a college student for 10 years.

175
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:10,305
I’ve been to 3 different colleges.

176
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:13,677
Before coming here, I was afraid that no one would like to hang out with me.

177
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:15,506
When these two came along,

178
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:17,709
I opened up, giving them all my heart.

179
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:20,702
I took them to my hometown, meeting my parents.

180
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:24,607
If there’s anything that sets them apart from me,

181
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:27,982
it will hit me hard.

182
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:35,508
Metha,

183
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:38,909
do you think I’m being absurd here?

184
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:41,167
Give me a serious answer. No jokes, okay?

185
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:43,708
You put a brake on my joke?

186
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:49,979
But I can’t judge you on this type of thing.

187
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:54,503
Hey, aren't you all supposed to be in that show?

188
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:57,306
Don’t you have to put your focus on the competition first?

189
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:59,205
You’ll have to see them anyway.

190
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:00,703
I know.

191
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,282
I’m just afraid that things won’t be the same between me and them.

192
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,305
Do you get it?

193
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,050
[Unky… do not throw away this. Please read it.]

194
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,979
Ngawwwwwwwwww.

195
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:56,619
Ngawwwwwwwwww.

196
00:11:57,539 --> 00:11:58,219
What the heck is wrong with you?

197
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:01,407
Ngawwwwwwwwww.

198
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:04,604
Another ‘Ngaww’ and I whack you with the book spine.

199
00:12:06,345 --> 00:12:09,438
Ngawwwwwwwwww.

200
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:11,641
Ouchhhhhhhh.

201
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:12,607
You heartless friend.

202
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,213
You’re not the same anymore.

203
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,306
Not the same how?

204
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:17,308
You’re dating someone, and you didn’t let me know.

205
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:19,505
Me? Dating?

206
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:20,605
No, I’m not.

207
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:26,013
You and Premmy, the little chef of yours.

208
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:28,204
We’re not a thing yet. Where did you even hear that?

209
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:31,712
So that old man lied to me.

210
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,977
He was all alone eating snacks.

211
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:36,208
I asked him where his friends were.

212
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:38,608
And he claimed they all ditched him for their boyfriends.

213
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:44,816
So I assumed you and Premmy, the little chef of yours, were a thing.

214
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,980
Maybe he was talking about Fire and Dynamite.

215
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,634
Ah, really?

216
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:51,205
What about you?

217
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,795
I’m waiting for Prem to finish his competition first.

218
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,414
Then I’ll ask him to be my boyfriend.

219
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:58,205
Why? Why do you have to wait for that?

220
00:12:58,272 --> 00:13:01,601
If I ask him out now, he won’t be able to concentrate on his competition.

221
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,007
Come on, Mr. 10.

222
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:06,207
People can date anytime.

223
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,979
This is even the perfect time for you, you know.

224
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:10,506
He’ll have your full support in his battle.

225
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:15,336
Ngawwwwwwwwww.

226
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:16,831
Remember when we were applying for college?

227
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:20,463
You dedicated all of your time to being with your sweetheart

228
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:24,165
and failed to pass the score and couldn’t get into med school with me.

229
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:25,924
Ouch.

230
00:13:27,863 --> 00:13:28,706
That hurts.

231
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:32,505
I got your point now.

232
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:33,979
What did you get?

233
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:37,207
I got that you are chicken-hearted.

234
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:38,908
No, I’m not.

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,980
Wait and see.

236
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,640
Once the first round of the competition is over,

237
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,004
I’ll ask him to be my boyfriend right away.

238
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:44,205
Wait and see.

239
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,576
Ngawwwwwwwwww.

240
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:51,408
Way to go, tiger.

241
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,605
We trained with all three of us.

242
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:00,607
I never imagined that only us two would be left.

243
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:03,124
When I got into the room last night,

244
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,980
I put my palms up to show my apology right away.

245
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:07,980
Did he forgive you?

246
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,899
No.

247
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:10,293
He was still mad?

248
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:10,970
No, he wasn’t home.

249
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:14,154
I didn’t know where he went.

250
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:15,309
He didn’t pick up my calls.

251
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,303
Is it just the two of us left to fight for real?

252
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:34,405
I don’t think we can do this alone.

253
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,408
Let’s go back.

254
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,300
Where are you headed?

255
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:42,407
Dy and I don’t think we can do this alone.

256
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:45,305
Don’t give up just yet.

257
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:47,601
You’ve trained so hard for this.

258
00:14:48,248 --> 00:14:49,601
You can do it. Trust me.

259
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:55,705
But there are just two people on our team.

260
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:57,502
Others have three.

261
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:00,800
Said who?

262
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:01,604
1

263
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:02,311
2

264
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:03,608
3

265
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,005
Even though I’m not participating in the competition with you,

266
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:09,702
I’ll always be there for you as your power bank.

267
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:16,407
I want to have my own power bank too.

268
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:23,302
The Three Must-Eat-eers, please go change over there.

269
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:40,531
Heh? Where’s the school-lover old man?

270
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,305
Did he get cold feet and drop out?

271
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,761
When you are a full team of three, you can never beat me.

272
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:51,251
And look what we have here.

273
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:53,401
Two losers.

274
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:55,401
How do you even stand a chance against me?

275
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:57,577
Oh my goodness.

276
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:02,202
Hey, shallow head, can I check?

277
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:04,202
Knock, knock.

278
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,520
Anybody here?

279
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:09,742
Oh, nothing.

280
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:11,211
Sorry.

281
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:12,902
Can I check it again?

282
00:16:16,651 --> 00:16:18,797
Don’t touch him. I don’t like it.

283
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:25,980
You have a bodyguard?

284
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:27,401
Just you wait.

285
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,506
I’ll show you a valuable lesson.

286
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,102
See you later.

287
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:34,508
Let’s go.

288
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:38,503
Thank you, Doc.

289
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:42,231
I’ll go get changed now.

290
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:54,608
Are you ready?

291
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,976
Is the issue with Samsee still bothering you?

292
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,008
Um.

293
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,506
I don’t know if he’s already cooled down and forgiven us.

294
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:08,697
Friends don’t stay mad too long.

295
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:09,600
Trust me.

296
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:15,700
Come on. Get up.

297
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,619
Cheer up!

298
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:18,408
Cheer up!

299
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:20,708
Stop worrying about that, okay?

300
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:23,405
Boost your energy now.

301
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:27,977
Come on.

302
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:29,977
Be the Dynamy I know.

303
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,611
Let me fire you up.

304
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,804
What are you doing?

305
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:55,708
I’m igniting this dynamite.

306
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:06,801
Do you feel the fire now?

307
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:07,810
A little bit warm.

308
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,053
It’s hot, right?

309
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,100
It’s down to the fuse now.

310
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:16,791
Here’s the fuse.

311
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:19,002
Boom!

312
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,125
What are you playing?

313
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:23,112
I like it.

314
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,420
How is this dynamite doing?

315
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:34,684
Does it have some energy yet?

316
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:35,863
Full energy now.

317
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:36,780
Can you do it one more time?

318
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,207
I wasn’t fully prepared earlier.

319
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,219
Right there?

320
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:40,506
Sure.

321
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:52,925
Thank you, Fy,

322
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:56,810
for building up both energy and fire in me.

323
00:18:57,997 --> 00:19:03,592
Here I am!!!!

324
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:05,605
Are you scared of them?

325
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,405
You look so pale.

326
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:10,705
Do I look that pale?

327
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,801
What was that for?

328
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,558
It’s not pale anymore. It’s turning red.

329
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,805
But only this side is red…

330
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,102
I have to make the other side red equally too.

331
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:25,505
But it’s not red enough.

332
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:35,214
Okay. The perfect level of red now.

333
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:36,552
I want to have a red face too.

334
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:40,813
Doc.

335
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:42,909
I’m still under stress.

336
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,515
I’m trying to destress you.

337
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,979
How about you just stand still, relax and gather your focus?

338
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:51,979
I’ll help you change your clothes.

339
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:54,702
Come on.

340
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:49,502
You’re all set.

341
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,204
Are you still feeling stressed?

342
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,497
Your friend will show up no matter what.

343
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:01,814
Trust me.

344
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:11,980
What if he doesn’t?

345
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,703
I will count to 5.

346
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:18,770
If your remaining member is not here,

347
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:20,207
you’re considered disqualified.

348
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:21,802
5

349
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:23,800
4

350
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,309
3

351
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:28,500
2

352
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:30,605
1

353
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:33,899
That’s me.

354
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:37,410
Doc!

355
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:40,909
I’m the third member of The Three Must-Eat-eers.

356
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:42,909
Wait a minute.

357
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,715
There can’t be a surprise from the audience...

358
00:21:45,724 --> 00:21:47,388
claiming to be the third team member.

359
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:48,610
What trick are you pulling here?

360
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:53,979
I want to participate and become the third member of The Three Must-Eat-eers.

361
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,509
What has gotten into him? Why all of a sudden…

362
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:58,810
I don’t know either.

363
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,200
He’s probably trying to help us.

364
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:03,703
Will the judges allow this?

365
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:07,979
I'm not the one to decide on this.

366
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,979
The decision must come from the judges.

367
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:11,979
I don’t allow it.

368
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:15,977
Chang Ma.

369
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:17,207
Why can’t I join?

370
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:19,407
The rules clearly specify that

371
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:23,207
contenders must be the original members when applying.

372
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:29,204
This is to prevent professional chefs from switching in.

373
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:30,848
But I’m not a professional chef.

374
00:22:31,588 --> 00:22:33,008
I’m a med student

375
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:37,977
who wants to stand by his side. That’s all.

376
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:41,983
The rules are the rules.

377
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:43,982
Everyone involved must comply with them.

378
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:46,345
This show has been around for years.

379
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:49,509
No one is rude enough to switch in the middle of the show like this before.

380
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:53,977
Well, the show is yet to begin,

381
00:22:54,054 --> 00:22:55,982
and The Three Must-Eat-eers have already encountered a dramatic incident.

382
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:57,002
Wait a minute.

383
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:58,706
What right do you have to say that?

384
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,979
Let me clarify for him.

385
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:09,305
Our show invited Chef Chang Ma to be our special judge in this team competition.

386
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:11,109
I just…

387
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:13,109
It’s okay, Doc.

388
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:17,408
Thank you so much.

389
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:19,613
I know you want to help us.

390
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,106
Well then, can you allow us to compete with just two members?

391
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:32,905
Actually, it’s not against the rules.

392
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:34,807
But…

393
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,204
Chef Paul…

394
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:55,068
Chef Paul said regardless of the team name, The Three Must-Eat-eers,

395
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,979
the rules don't specify that it must contain three people.

396
00:23:58,494 --> 00:24:00,605
Two members are fine.

397
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:04,404
However, do not use this disadvantage as an excuse in the competition.

398
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,983
Seriously, all he did was rub his chin and tap his temple.

399
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:13,983
How could it get translated that long?

400
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:16,509
We allow them to compete.

401
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:35,140
And for this round,

402
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,998
every team must create a dish that represents their team the best.

403
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:41,974
You'll have 45 minutes.

404
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:43,974
Please go to your station and get started.

405
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:45,705
Move it.

406
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:47,106
Come on.

407
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:55,718
(What does each team have in their sleeves?)

408
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,758
(This is very interesting to see.)

409
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,668
(Yeah, especially The Three Must-Eat-eers.)

410
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:03,610
(It’s interesting to see how they'll handle this with just two members in the team.)

411
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,514
It’s not running. The power is off?

412
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,551
Probably.

413
00:25:23,831 --> 00:25:25,979
And here’s the surprise from the show–

414
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:27,979
cutting the power down.

415
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:31,614
No one gets to use any electrical appliances.

416
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:37,022
Whatever happens, be it no water or no power,

417
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:39,977
you all must find a way to finish your cooking and serve your customers.

418
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:41,002
Please continue.

419
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:43,002
Go get the coffee dripper.

420
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:45,404
It’s alright. We can still strain it.

421
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,865
(We can see that The Three Must-Eat-eers is using a traditional method.)

422
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:03,413
- (But can they finish it in time?)
- You don’t have much time left. Please speed up, everyone.

423
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:11,420
You don’t have much time left.

424
00:26:11,431 --> 00:26:12,560
Those prawns are still cold.

425
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:13,506
Got it, Chef.

426
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:14,946
It seems like the show wants to see

427
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,807
which team can find the best workaround without using power.

428
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:19,877
That’s merciless.

429
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,394
You grab the tongs. I'll start frying this right now.

430
00:26:21,437 --> 00:26:22,317
Okay, sure.

431
00:26:24,078 --> 00:26:24,708
Ouch.

432
00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:33,311
No. Wait!

433
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,980
Take it easy. Where do you think you are going? They are filming.

434
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:39,644
Holy shit.

435
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:40,807
(This is not good.)

436
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:45,505
(The main protein of their dish is prawns. And they are all on the floor.)

437
00:26:45,696 --> 00:26:49,010
(With not much time left, where will they get extra prawns?)

438
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:51,979
(What do you think, Chef?)
- I'm sorry.

439
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:52,917
(That could mean it’s the end of their journey.)

440
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:54,508
You go peel new prawns, I’ll clean it up.

441
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:55,979
No more prawns left.

442
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:15,506
I’m here.

443
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,213
I’m here!

444
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:22,407
I’m here!!!

445
00:27:23,546 --> 00:27:24,499
Hey.

446
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:27,411
Unky!

447
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:29,980
(This is like a miracle.)

448
00:27:30,077 --> 00:27:33,032
(Samsee, the other member of The Three Must-Eat-eers, appears)

449
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:35,931
(like a knight on a white horse to save his team at the last minute.)

450
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,106
Why did you just get here?

451
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:39,709
You let your friends go through all the ordeals by themselves.

452
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:42,616
I had to grab these prawns; that's why I’m late.

453
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:44,306
But there’s still time, right?

454
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,509
It’s up to the judges if they’ll let you join the competition or not.

455
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,802
Chef Paul mentioned you let your team face a disadvantage for too long.

456
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:12,357
Other teams have three, while your team has just two.

457
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:13,506
We're running out of time.

458
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:16,202
Are you going to stand there and let the clock run out?

459
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:18,426
- Hurry up.
- Thank you!

460
00:28:19,386 --> 00:28:21,247
Prem, you take care of the prawns.

461
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:22,528
I’ll prepare the noodles.

462
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:23,314
Move it!

463
00:28:26,995 --> 00:28:28,687
Are you sure this is the fastest speed you can pull?

464
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:30,709
You must be way faster.

465
00:28:31,725 --> 00:28:34,706
Faster. Time is running out.

466
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:41,103
How is your team, Samsee?

467
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:41,982
Is it still within your control?

468
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:43,005
Yes, Chef.

469
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,605
It’s down to the last 10 seconds.

470
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:11,906
10

471
00:29:12,423 --> 00:29:13,305
9

472
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,608
8

473
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:15,903
7

474
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,362
6

475
00:29:18,118 --> 00:29:18,808
5

476
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:20,315
4

477
00:29:20,847 --> 00:29:21,715
3

478
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:23,210
2

479
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:24,808
1

480
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:26,908
Time’s up.

481
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:32,411
Hey.

482
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:34,807
What?

483
00:29:35,552 --> 00:29:36,709
It’s over?

484
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:39,207
I came here too late?

485
00:29:39,757 --> 00:29:41,976
No. They just finished cooking.

486
00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:44,906
The judges are yet to taste their dishes and grade them.

487
00:30:13,985 --> 00:30:19,108
Do you realize you spent an incredibly long time making this simple dish?

488
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:23,074
Do you think this simple dish can secure your spot in the next round?

489
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,982
This dish is called

490
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:39,979
"Deep-fried Prawns Wrapped in Noodles with Trio Paste Smoked Mayo."

491
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,202
Even though it's a simple dish,

492
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:45,804
it holds invaluable meaning for all three of us.

493
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,025
[Unky, we are deeply sorry and understand why you are mad.]
[Don’t think that we overlook your feelings.]

494
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,008
[You are our friend, our big brother, the person who’s always there for us.]
[Even though you are still very angry. We’re okay if you choose to drop out.]

495
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,982
[Please take a look at the dish we have chosen to cook at the show.]
[You’ll find out you are really a part of our team.]

496
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,970
[Chosen Dish: Deep-fried Prawns Wrapped in Noodles with Trio Paste Smoked Mayo.]

497
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,616
T-shirts ready!

00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,906
Yes, Chef.

499
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:03,702
The river prawns we use here are sourced from Suphanburi,

500
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,980
Samsee’s hometown.

501
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,703
Shou Mian noodles symbolize my Chinese-Thai heritage.

502
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,208
The smoked wood fire captures the fiery intensity of Dynamite.

503
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:19,210
Each element represents the three of us as a trio of best friends.

504
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:22,527
The prawns are marinated with Trio Paste

505
00:32:22,545 --> 00:32:24,157
and tightly wrapped with the noodles,

506
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:26,201
just like our tight bond,

507
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:28,632
paired with Trio Paste Mayo sauce.

508
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,583
These distinctive contrasting elements,

509
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,102
when blended harmoniously, can enhance the flavor and identity of this dish.

510
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:37,708
This dish represents a friendship bond,

511
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:39,804
signifying that we will never abandon one another.

512
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:45,607
Unky,

513
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:49,108
I'm sorry.

514
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:55,306
Why the drama? I don’t want to cry here.

515
00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:21,524
Alright, the judges have finalized their assessment through all four teams.

516
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:22,611
We’ll take a short break.

517
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:27,011
Please stay tuned for Super Monster Chef.

518
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,703
Hey, I think this is the time.

519
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:30,970
You think so?

520
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,977
Yes.

521
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:33,105
Right now?

522
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:34,619
Go for it.

523
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,511
Are you going there on your own, or letting me and Fire drag your ass?

524
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:38,706
I’m good, thanks.

525
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:41,734
Let’s join in and witness the moment.

526
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:43,109
Can’t miss it.

527
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:45,700
We thought you wouldn’t show up.

528
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:47,977
Yeah, you didn’t pick up my calls.

529
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:49,100
What a jerk.

530
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:53,508
I was catching prawns at the time.

531
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:55,811
I dropped my phone in the river, you know.

532
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:57,008
Seriously?

533
00:33:57,576 --> 00:33:59,408
I was in a hurry. I didn’t want to be late.

534
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:01,008
I almost couldn’t make it.

535
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:03,205
Will you accept my apology?

536
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:05,500
We don’t want your apology.

537
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,204
It’s us who should apologize to you.

538
00:34:14,897 --> 00:34:18,173
I admitted that I got upset for real.

539
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,977
After giving it some thought, I realized that I was being too childish.

540
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:25,208
I was overly worried that you two might ditch me for your lovers.

541
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:28,608
I’m this old.

542
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:31,010
Where can I make a new friend now?

543
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:34,610
We could never do that to you.

544
00:34:35,352 --> 00:34:36,211
Never.

545
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:41,402
Friends don’t stay mad too long, right?

546
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:46,706
Hey, easy. It’s ticklish!

547
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:51,405
From now on, we will talk it out and tell everything to each other.

548
00:34:51,928 --> 00:34:52,506
Um.

549
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:56,214
Let’s start by inviting you back to our chat group.

550
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,002
Alright, just send the invitation to me.

551
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,080
When my phone is fixed, I’ll accept it.

552

[The Three Must-Eat-eers (2)]
When my phone is fixed, I’ll accept it.

553

[The Three Must-Eat-eers (2)]

554
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,031
[Samsee]

555
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:05,450
Done.
[Samsee]

556
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:05,977
Done.

557
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,410
[Where are you, Doc?]

558
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,970
[Where are you, Doc?]

559
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,930
[I was out to get everyone drinks. Going back now.]

560
00:35:25,361 --> 00:35:27,804
We don’t allow food and drinks here.

561
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:32,207
I don’t see any banning signs.

562
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,306
You are really clueless about various things.

563
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,204
What do you want to say to me, just say it.

564
00:35:43,262 --> 00:35:44,404
I like Prem.

565
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:48,607
And I know that you like Prem too.

566
00:35:48,697 --> 00:35:50,802
Otherwise, you won’t stay in my way like this.

567
00:35:51,797 --> 00:35:54,801
Anyway, I just want to let you know,

568
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:57,205
so it’s fair to both you and me.

569
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,804
I think you’re wasting your time here.

570
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:01,979
Prem doesn’t like you.

571
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:03,800
He likes me.

572
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,408
Are you two official yet?

573
00:36:11,189 --> 00:36:11,982
Not yet.

574
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:14,810
He asks to put his focus on this competition first.

575
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:18,303
That could be just an excuse.

576
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:21,005
He may not feel certain about you.

577
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:23,982
I think I know Prem well.

578
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:26,608
That’s up to you.

579
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,908
But for me, if Prem isn’t in an official relationship with anyone,

580
00:36:32,299 --> 00:36:33,703
that means I still stand a chance.

581
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:38,208
We’re about to resume now.

582
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:39,117
Alright.

583
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:45,983
After this,

584
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,008
I hope you won’t get upset to see any moves I’ll make.

585
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,309
Because you had no claim on him from the start.

586
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:14,908
Here we are.

587
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:21,705
Only three teams will advance to the next round.

588
00:37:23,948 --> 00:37:30,706
And the first team to go through to the next round is

589
00:37:32,214 --> 00:37:33,108
Team…

590
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,108
Team…

591
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:40,204
Team Mise en Place.

592
00:37:40,294 --> 00:37:41,296
Yeah.

593
00:37:41,388 --> 00:37:41,977
Yes.

594
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,411
Oh my god.

595
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:57,005
And the second team to advance to the next round is...

00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:12,819
And the last team to compete in the next round,

601
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,600
who will it be?

602
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:19,982
Outstanding or The Three Must-Eat-eers.

603
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:23,980
And the last team to get through is…

604
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:25,980
Congrats to…

605

to…

607
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:29,977
to…

608
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:32,644
Gosh, I almost wet my pants here.

609
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:33,693
Say it already.

610
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:34,576

I’ve made it to the next round.

617
00:38:57,989 --> 00:38:59,980
You did great. Really great.

618
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,004
Truly amazing.

619
00:39:03,294 --> 00:39:04,629
I’m nervous.

620
00:39:04,644 --> 00:39:06,411
I don’t think I can do well in the next round.

621
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,802
No, you will do well. Be confident.

622
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:10,802
Just enough to get by.

623
00:39:11,008 --> 00:39:13,207
You also saw it. We almost got kicked out of the competition.

624
00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:19,509
Here’s the deal.

625
00:39:21,176 --> 00:39:23,988
If you win this show, I’ll have a reward for you.

626
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,303
What is it?

627
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,509
Nosy old man!

628
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:28,909
What is it?

629
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,214
I’ll tell everyone that we’re dating.

630
00:39:34,423 --> 00:39:35,306
For real?

631
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:36,702
For real.

632
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:38,305
You must not take back your word.

633
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:39,977
Okay.

634
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:42,640
Okay. I’m now confident.

635
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:45,717
I’m not scared of anyone at this point.

636
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:48,211
Give it your all, okay?

637
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,109
Feeling stiff?

638
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:53,505
Are you going to let him surpass you?

639
00:39:53,986 --> 00:39:56,305
Take it easy. I’m about to start now.

640
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:57,306
This is exciting.

641
00:39:57,367 --> 00:39:59,805
Chef, I have something to tell you.

642
00:40:01,205 --> 00:40:02,805
What’s wrong? Why make such a face?

643
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:06,404
Boon is going to crush us in the next round.

644
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:09,314
It hasn’t started, don’t get worried too far ahead.

645
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:14,503
If I have a reward for you, will it make you fired up?

646
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,213
What is it?

647
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,111
Pick one. Any of them.

648
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:23,721
This one.

649
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:24,309
Okay.

650
00:40:37,072 --> 00:40:37,982
Open it.

651
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,770
[Ten hugs Prem]

652
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,309
What’s the other one?

653
00:40:45,517 --> 00:40:47,797
No, you already picked that one.

654
00:40:48,254 --> 00:40:49,608
But I want to see.

655
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,690
[Prem gets hugged by Ten.]

656
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:05,002
Nothing much.

657
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:07,303
I just want to hug you.

658
00:41:11,985 --> 00:41:14,308
Ask him. Ask him now. This is the time.

659
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,105
I’m fired up now.

660
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:22,392
Let’s find something delicious to eat.

661
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:24,200
Good idea. Where should we go?

662
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,982
Come on, Oldie!

663
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:28,071
You are gluttonous all the time.

664

Are you insulting me, Gray Hair?

665

Sure.

666
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:32,605
Stop fighting. How about my place?

667
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:35,605
Let’s order something in. The more the merrier.

668
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:36,804
Good idea.

669
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,949
Okay. Fy, you come with me.

670
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:40,807
Prem, you go with Dr. Ten.

671
00:41:41,157 --> 00:41:42,610
What about me?

672
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,303
Am I going with that gray hair dude?

673
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:45,709
Damn right, Oldie.

674
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:50,900
Hey, ask him on the way there. Say it.

675
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,730
You can do it.

676
00:41:51,745 --> 00:41:52,405
Okay.

677
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:56,503
Come on, Oldie.

678
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,306
Move it.

679
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:02,300
I don’t want to go with him.

680
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,300
Come on.

681
00:42:04,764 --> 00:42:08,223
Let me grab a snack for now. I’m so hungry.

682
00:42:14,973 --> 00:42:15,977
What do you want to eat?

683
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:17,093
I want to eat you.

684
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:19,093
Huh?

685
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,069
I mean I can eat anything with you.

686
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:26,509
Ah, I got shocked for a second there.

687
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:29,100
Chef…

688
00:42:30,992 --> 00:42:33,810
Finally, there’s only us here.

689
00:42:34,674 --> 00:42:37,008
Can I have a word with you?

690
00:42:39,388 --> 00:42:40,213
What is it?

691
00:42:41,954 --> 00:42:45,708
Well, you have finished the first round of the competition.

692
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:51,608
You can put your focus on some other things too, right?

693
00:42:52,122 --> 00:42:53,608
It won’t distract you, right?

694
00:42:55,568 --> 00:42:56,500
Um.

695
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,801
What other things?

696
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:03,666
About us.

697
00:43:04,777 --> 00:43:09,980
Well, I wanted to tell you this when you visited me at the Physicians’ Housing.

698
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:12,798
We put our hands in the oven glove together.

699
00:43:14,471 --> 00:43:15,235
Oven glove….

700
00:43:15,244 --> 00:43:15,960
Yes, that.

701
00:43:15,977 --> 00:43:17,982
Hold on. I forgot my oven glove.

702
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:21,202
What?

703
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,506
I’m about to ask him to be my boyfriend.

704
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:46,361
Hey.

705
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,718
I think Boon's team will definitely succeed again in the next round.

706
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:51,401
But The Three Must-Eat-eers show some potential too.

707
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:52,869
Potential to flop, I believe.

708
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:56,207
The producers put The Three jokers through

709
00:43:56,413 --> 00:43:58,600
because they always get stuck at something.

710
00:43:58,912 --> 00:44:02,407
It’s entertaining to see these losers get crushed.

711
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:03,703
That's typical, right?

712
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:07,508
The show needs some underperforming contestants to add fun.

713
00:44:07,822 --> 00:44:08,804
- Right?
- Yes.

714
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:10,802
Let's quickly put this back.

715
00:44:11,226 --> 00:44:12,506
Let’s head home.

716
00:44:24,585 --> 00:44:28,804
Prem, is everything alright?

717
00:44:34,761 --> 00:44:35,979
Earlier,

718
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:41,511
I overheard some staff talking about having my team as a joker

719
00:44:42,214 --> 00:44:43,511
to boost the viewer's rating.

720
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:48,302
Did you see who said such a thing?

721
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,611
I was kneeling down to get something so I didn’t see their faces.

722
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,013
They didn’t see me there, so they said that.

723
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:02,100
That’s not true.

724
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,604
Your team is great and has skills.

725
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:09,976
We indeed made quite a few mistakes,

726
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:11,976
and we weren’t as flawless as the other teams.

727
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:14,918
We were clearly outperformed by them.

728
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:20,508
They put a lame team to advance to be like an underdog for the sake of ratings.

729
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:27,708
Don’t look down on yourself like that.

730
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,305
You also know that I've been lame all this time.

731
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,308
They are not wrong to think of me like that.

732
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:39,690
Prem.

733
00:45:41,231 --> 00:45:42,608
Don’t be harsh on yourself.

734
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,811
I only want to give you a supportive hug.

735
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:59,408
An embrace should make you feel better than talking.

736
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,308
I don’t think it’s a good idea.

737
00:46:05,183 --> 00:46:07,108
You know that I like you, right?

738
00:46:08,407 --> 00:46:09,976
Can’t you give me a chance?

739
00:46:18,022 --> 00:46:18,706
Doc!

740
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:23,514
Now you learned that you should stop when someone says no.

741
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:28,204
Doc!

742
00:46:31,442 --> 00:46:33,007
Chef Chang Ma, are you alright?

743
00:46:34,768 --> 00:46:36,407
Do you want us to take some action on them?

744
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:42,211
Why did you punch him?

745
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:45,207
If he had held back himself, I wouldn't have stepped in.

746
00:46:45,604 --> 00:46:47,202
But I don’t like you to react aggressively.

747
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:49,979
You didn’t know what he said to me.

748
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,702
What did he say?

749
00:46:52,948 --> 00:46:54,736
He claimed he had every right to make a move on you,

750
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:55,976
and I should stay away

751
00:46:56,075 --> 00:46:57,705
because we aren’t officially in a relationship.

752
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:00,306
Did he really say that?

753
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:04,408
Yes.

754
00:47:05,899 --> 00:47:10,210
I know that we agreed to get back to this once the competition is over.

755
00:47:10,491 --> 00:47:11,979
But if I don’t have any status with you,

756
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,308
I can’t fully protect you.

757
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,730
And what he tried to do, I feel like this is it.

758
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,807
It must be this time, right here, and right now.

759
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,977
Will you be my boyfriend, Chef?

760
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,706
I don’t want to waste any more time.

761
00:47:33,362 --> 00:47:35,204
I want to have you by my side

762
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:37,109
so that I can tell you I love you every day.

763
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,005
Can it be possible?

764
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:41,506
Can you let me do that?

765
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:46,205
If I do anything that upsets you,

766
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,204
you don’t have to give your answer right here.

767
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,201
Say no more.

768
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:07,983
Will you take that as my answer?

769
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,816
I haven’t heard that answer clearly yet.

770
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:19,109
I’ll be your boyfriend.

771
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:21,247
What did you just say?

772
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:22,804
What?

773
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,004
You still didn’t hear it?

774
00:48:28,714 --> 00:48:30,200
Not clearly yet.

775
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,509
I’ll be your boyfriend, Doc!

776
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,906
I have a sweetheart now!

777
00:49:04,924 --> 00:49:07,368
Prem and I are official now.

778
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:08,080
So what’s the deal?

779
00:49:08,094 --> 00:49:09,594
It’s what you think.

780
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,980
Is this type of food good enough to eat?

781
00:49:12,795 --> 00:49:15,282
The name of this course is “Boyfriends Day 1”.

782
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:18,425
People in relationships, what do they eat?

783
00:49:19,143 --> 00:49:19,977
(Doc!)

784
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,302
Did you really not see the comments from people watching that clip?

785
00:49:23,576 --> 00:49:27,208
They also criticize the one you vowed to protect.

786
00:49:27,988 --> 00:49:29,813
I’m not lame, right?

787
00:49:30,081 --> 00:49:33,514
These two hands create the most delicious food in the world.
