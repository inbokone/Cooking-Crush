4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,240
Why is your team down to just two members?

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,760
Where's the other one?

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
You grab the tongs. I'll start frying this right now.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,750
I’m here.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,620
Unky!

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,210
And the last team to compete in the next round,

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,620
The Three Must-Eat-eers!

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,060
You know that I like you, right?

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,060
Can’t you give me a chance?

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,540
He claimed he had every right to make a move on you,

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,300
and I should stay away because we aren’t officially in a relationship.

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,940
Will you be my boyfriend, Chef?

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,360
I’ll be your boyfriend, Doc!

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
I have a sweetheart now!

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,520
Seriously,

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,530
I’ve just come out of a tough cooking match.

20
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,290
Why do I still have to cook here again?

21
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,450
Fy, you should help me.

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,040
But I can't cook.

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,120
Fine, if it turns out terrible, don’t curse me.

24
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,260
I'll do it myself.

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,010
Look, another owner of this house.

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,900
Pang! Join us for a hotpot?

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,660
I just got back from cram school.

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,040
My tummy is growling.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,490
Prem’s little sis.

30
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,390
Ah.

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,440
We've bought a lot for everyone. Come and join us.

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,030
I suddenly crave pad thai.

33
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,460
I'm going to buy it now.

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,890
What?

35
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,940
But she told us she wanted to join our hotpot.

36
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,000
What does she have against me?

37
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,650
She hates you, Unky?

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,550
I could totally see why.

39
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:56,940
- You gray-hair bastard!

40
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,890
- You gray-hair bastard!
- You gray-hair bastard!

41
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:57,900
- You gray-hair bastard!

42
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,400
I knew that was coming.

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,080
Give me.

44
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,000
The chopsticks!

45
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,140
Should we ask Grandma to have the first bite?

46
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,700
She’s ironing and watching a TV drama.

47
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,720
I don’t want to get ironed instead.

48
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,300
Didn’t those two leave the place at the same time as us?

49
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,720
Why aren’t they here yet?

50
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,760
My guts say something is going on.

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,840
Yeah.

52
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,260
I’m with you on this.

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,440
Let’s interview them when they’re here.

54
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:26,500
Thanks.

55
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,260
Thanks.
Thanks.

56
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,270
Thanks.

57
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,020
Those guys may see us.

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,730
Let them see.

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,260
I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long.

60
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,550
Doc.

61
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,400
Come on, Chef.

62
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,760
Put some meat in.

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,000
Shit.

64
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,280
Fy, look.

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,230
What?

66
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,270
What’s going on, Prem?

67
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,050
Look at your hand locking.

68
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,060
You can’t let go of each other’s hands like that.

69
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,060
Don’t tell me, Ten.

70
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,490
Prem and I…

71
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,950
are official now.

72
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,650
Yeah!!!!!!

73
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,020
Woah.

74
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,110
Not in front of our hotpot.

Or…The Three Must-Eat-eers Will Only Be a Name

88
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,290
So what’s the deal?

89
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,210
It’s what you think.

90
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,250
Well then, what I think is quite extreme.

91
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,040
Then stop it right there.

92
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,800
He asked me to be his boyfriend.

93
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,980
I also like him.

94
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,960
Why would I turn him down?

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,790
How’s the dip going?

96
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,760
Can’t you be apart even for a minute?

97
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,760
He’s been out here for a while.

98
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
I’m afraid he might be hungry.

99
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,250
Here.

100
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,340
Fy, have a meatball ready to feed me right away.

101
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,210
Right right away!

102
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,210
I must have it once I get there. I’m so hungry.

103
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,320
I can’t wait to eat that meatball.

104
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,480
Was that good?

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,630
Yes.

106
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,030
Have you had anything?

107
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,430
Not yet.

108
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,350
My boyfriend hasn’t started eating.

109
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,960
I can’t eat.

110
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,840
Keep sweet-talking like this for as long as possible.

111
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,410
Do you want to try this?

112
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,160
Um.

113
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,930
How could a seafood dip be this sweet?

114
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,480
25% sweet

115
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,650
Here is 50%

116
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,360
It’s sweet here too.

117
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,750
100%

118
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,440
It’s even getting into my eyes now.

119
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,890
I might get diabetes.

120
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,410
Hey.

121
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,520
What are you doing?

122
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,520
Those guys might see us.

123
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,340
What to be afraid of? There are so many of them.

124
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,140
I’m being serious here. You’re still goofing around?

125
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,500
Here. Bring this dip to them. They’re waiting for it.

126
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,470
Why didn’t you wait for them? Fine, I’ll eat too.

127
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,630
Here you are.

128
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,360
Come sit here.

129
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,410
Why do I have to sit with you?

130
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,310
Thanks, My.

131
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,830
You should be grateful to have me sit next to you. Scoot over.

132
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,330
Not enough room for you.

133
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,480
Dig in, guys.

134
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,430
Try this one.

135
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,300
Let’s check the feedback on the show.

136
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,660
It’s already aired.

137
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,760
Sure.

138
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,440
We might become everyone’s favorite.

139
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,530
People might show interest in me.

140
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,890
Really, My? I’m going to sulk now.

141
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,090
Fine.

142
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,490
Give me one.

143
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,020
Sure.

144
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:26,990
You grab the tongs. I'll start frying this right now.

145
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,020
[Are they really serious or just here for fun? #hahaha]
You grab the tongs. I'll start frying this right now.

146
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,520
You grab the tongs. I'll start frying this right now.

147
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,160
Okay, sure.

148
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,480
No more prawns left.

149
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,830
I’m here!

150
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,210
I’m here!!!

151
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,210
Unky!

152
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,990
[Are they using baby prawns or something?]

153
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,030
[Seriously, they got through because of their tears?!]

154
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,290
What the? I see only bad comments.

155
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,090
Really? Let me see.

156
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,760
Hahaha. Is this a cooking show or a comedy gig?

157
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
The Three Must-Eat-eers or Three Jokers?

158
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,690
How did they even end up here? Their cooking sucks.

159
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,040
Shit, this one is harsh.

160
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,410
Come on. Cheer up.

161
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,940
You were in a great mood just a while ago.

162
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,790
I can’t be in high spirits anymore.

163
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,870
Even a fun guy can feel devastated too, you know?

164
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,140
There there.

165
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,480
Eat then. Let the food comfort you.

166
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,750
Want this? Though it’s hard to keep them in my chopsticks.

167
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,820
The show is not over.

168
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,340

Did you really not see the comments from people watching that clip?

473

They are ripping you apart, criticizing not only you

474

but also your father, your mother, and everyone else.

475

Do you even realize?

476

I couldn’t care less about those negative and useless comments.

I don’t really give a damn.

478

You just can’t ignore them.

479

This situation is getting much worse than you think.

480

What you did is dragging other people down with you.

481

Do you realize that your friends are facing harsh criticism too?

482
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,430
They are even criticizing the person you vowed to protect.

483

Do you understand now?

484
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,580
When anger gets the best of you, there will be consequences.

485
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,000
Though you may try to rectify what you did,

486
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,000
it may be too late.

487

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,880
I thought I could find him here.

508
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,880
He didn’t answer my calls.

509
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,380
Are you guys doing okay?

510
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,670
Doc.

511
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,080
(Hello, Chef. Where are you?)

512
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,010
We're trying to figure out what to do.

513
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,230
I'm sorry for causing you all this trouble.

514
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,050
Have you thought of what action you should take?

515
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,100
I've thought of some.

516
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,850
I'll take all the blame upon myself.

517
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,670
I'll also record a video stating that this has nothing to do with The Three Must-Eat-eers,

518
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,290
and that the attack was solely personal.

519
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,950
I want to be the only one targeted by this backlash.

520
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,580
I don’t think you should do anything.

521
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,120
No matter what you do, people will criticize you.

522
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,640
Trust me.

523
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,300
I agree.

524
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,680
We're a couple now.

525
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,060
We should go through highs and lows together.

526
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,280
Wow. You've really surpassed me, Prem.

527
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,460
Being romantic in the midst of drama.

528
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,770
Learn from them, Fy.

529
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,300
I want us to be like them too.

530
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,070
I knew it.

531
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,690
Yes, babe.

532
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,430
Hey, look, look, look.

533
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,200
There’s another clip.

534
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,880
Look.

535
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,420
If you ask us about The Three Must-Eat-eers.

536
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,820
We must admit that they are somewhat ‘hot-tempered.’

537
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,130
They are really hot-headed.

538
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,730
They tend to complain and yell.

539
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,640
They are full of themselves and like to bully others.

540
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:33,560
You know we all three are in the same class with them.

541
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,490
In the kitchen lab, there are fires and knives, right?

542
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,160
Those gangsters are always ready to confront us and hurt us.

543
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,500
We are really scared of them.

544
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
You can imagine what we have to face.

545
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,150
We’ve been frightened by their presence for so long.

546
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,960
Today, we’re relieved that the light has shone upon us

547
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,880
and chased away the darkness of evil.

548
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,210
We all three have come to a consensus

549
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,470
and request that Super Monster Chef

550
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,420
to remove The Three-Must-Eat-eers from the show immediately.

551
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,660
Please.

552
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,090
That’s bullshit.

553
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,920
I can’t believe those jerks.

554
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,680
They shouldn’t have studied culinary.

555
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,860
They should be in acting class.

556
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,860
Those behaviors are simply them.

557
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,230
I’m not that kind of person, Fy.

558
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
I know, My. I know.

559
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,790
You are just foul-mouthed.

560
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,740
The Three Must-Eat-eers must be banned.

561
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,460
Or else we will ban the show.

562
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,520
So many people agree with this comment.

563
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,730
Damn. How could people believe them?

564
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,000
Look.

565
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,000
Can’t they see that these jerks are just putting on an act?

566
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,260
I think the show is trying to discredit your team.

567
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,520
Or else they wouldn’t let these three get interviewed.

568
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,090
The more people talk about it, the more attention is drawn to the show.

569
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,700
For engagement, do they have to go this far?

570
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,700
We’re also their contestants.

571
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,870
Shouldn’t they care about our feelings too?

572
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,660
Isn’t this too much?

573
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,840
This situation is getting much worse than you think.

574
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,610
What you did is dragging other people down with you.

575
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,160
Do you realize that your friends are facing harsh criticism too?

576
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,160
They are even criticizing the person you vowed to protect.

577
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,250
Ten, where are you off to?

578
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,990
I’m going to handle this with them.

579
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,640
Doc!

580
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,140
Calm down.

581
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,520
Doc!

582
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,510
I think we should remove The Three Must-Eat-eers from the show.

583
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,800
Doc!

584
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,220
What are you going to do?

585
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,010
Don’t do it, Doc!

586
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,130
I’m going to put an end to it.
Don’t do it, Doc!

587
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,270
I’m going to put an end to it.

588
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:45,720
Doc.

589
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,440
Doc!

590
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,150
Who let them in? Stop them.

591
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,000
Doc, please, I beg you.

592
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,620
Doc!

593
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,860
Please accept my apology

594
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,260
for my violent behavior toward you.

595
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,530
Listen,

596
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,250
isn’t it too late to apologize?

597
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,810
You should have restrained yourself before throwing a punch.

598
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,560
What you did is breaking the internet right now.

599
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,220
People are banning your team.

600
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,050
I did wrong.

601
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,960
I want to take all the blame to myself

602
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,230
so that The Three Must-Eat-eers won’t get misunderstood.

603
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,280
I think you should lay low and let things calm down.

604
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,740
Honestly, we made the wrong decision.

605
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,560
We shouldn’t have chosen the team that is utterly lame for the show.

606
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,670
We thought it'd boost ratings and add some spice to the show.

607
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,240
But the feedback we're getting is terrible.

608
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,240
And we’re trying to find a way out.

609
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,470
I can record an apology statement.

610
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,070
The fault lies solely with me.

611
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,450
You don’t need to do that.

612
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,840
My team will withdraw.

613
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,840
This should end the issue.

614
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,010
Chef, no.

615
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,500
Please let me talk.

616
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,550
You were right about what you said.

617
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,050
We are lame.

618
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,370
We are in the show for entertainment purposes.

619
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,220
It’s the right move to fix the problem by removing us.

620
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,800
That’s not right.

621
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,800
I was the one who caused the problem.

622
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,740
I beg you.

623
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,450
Can you please separate personal issues from the competition?

624
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,450
They have no involvement in this.

625
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,710
Can you let them continue?

626
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,900
Please, I beg you.

627
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,590
Doc!

628
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,920
Okay.

629
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,900
No hard feelings. I forgive you.

630
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,400
But I still insist on withdrawing.

631
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,650
Prem, can I have a word?

632
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,820
Just you and me.

633
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,650
You saw the feedback, right?

634
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,650
Yes.

635
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,350
Still hurt by it?

636
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:09,230
Though it hurts, we have to accept it, right?

637
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,370
Even though I can talk to them to let you stay in the competition,

638
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,210
do you still want to drop out?

639
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,210
Prem,

640
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,170
do you know why I like you?

641
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:39,320
Because you are someone with strong determination.

642
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,810
You are enthusiastic.

643
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,250
Despite making many mistakes, you never give up.

644
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,930
But probably

645
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,850
this is too much for you to bear.

646
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,160
I’ll respect whatever decision you make.

647
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,560
What did he say to you?

648
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:26,170
He said he could talk them in to let my team stay.

649
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,040
But the decision is mine to make.

650
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,580
I don’t know what to do, Doc.

651
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,680
I've lost all confidence.

652
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,770
I understand that you're feeling low on confidence.

653
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,930
Some might perceive your team as incompetent,

654
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,540
prone to mistakes, and a laughing matter.

655
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,060
But there's more to it.

656
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,880
The major part of this mess is due to my recklessness.

657
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,470
I'm the reason things escalated.

658
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,090
It’s totally fine, Doc.

659
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,850
I know you did that to protect me. I understand.

660
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,560
I know that you understand me.

661
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,240
But…

662
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,020
I must learn not to repeat this kind of behavior.

663
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,180
I cannot let my recklessness hurt you anymore.

664
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,750
Thank you, Doc.

665
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,830
What I did is nothing compared to what you’ve endured.

666
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,510
Look at your arms.

667
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,510
This mark was from oil splatters.

668
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,930
This was from boiling water.

669
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,230
Do you know why you have these marks?

670
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,620
Because of my clumsiness?

671
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,160
Because of your determination.

I know how much you love cooking.

673

It brings you joy whenever you get to cook.

674
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,440
Don’t let your determination go in vain.

675
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,880
I’m…

676
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,220
I’m not lame, right?

677

These two hands create the most delicious food in the world.

678
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,330
Thank you, Doc.

679
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,570
Chef Chang Ma, I have made my decision.

680
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,440
I would like to stay in the competition.

681
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,720
Alright.

682
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,130
I’ll make sure you get that chance.

683
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,290
(I’m Chef Chang Ma, the special judge of Super Monster Chef.)

684
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,930
(Regarding the controversy involving one of our teams,

685
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,890
The Three-Must-Eat-eers, I would like to clarify here...)

686
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,040
I was the one who provoked that party.

687
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,890
The truth is, we had some conflicts before.

688
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:12,130
And I was partly at fault.

689
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,840
(Importantly, this issue has no relation

690
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,080
to the contestants in the show, as many people understand.)

691
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,250
That party has already apologized to me.

692
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:27,940
The Three Must-Eat-eers team has done nothing wrong.

693
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,380
Let's not shut the doors on those individuals with dreams

694
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,500
who have nothing to do with the issue.

695
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:35,410
Thank you.

How did it go?

00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,920
The feedback is positive now, right?

703
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,300
Chef Chang Ma? His statement was really impressive.

704
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,630
How could you praise another man in front of your man?

705
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:57,970
Are you mad?

706
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,490
No, I’m not. Just kidding.

707
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,290
I know you don't have feelings for him.

708
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:11,120
Also, I think he sees you’ve got skills.

709
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,580
So he wants you to prove others wrong.

710
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:18,290
But this time, I’m really determined to make it happen.
