5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,070
I will.

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,440
That’s me, Prem.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,730
My house is a small restaurant by the canal.

8
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,600
I have to wake up early and ride a motorcycle like this every day.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,250
Why do I do this?

10
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,180
Because the early bird gets the worm.

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,020
A worm!

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,810
That's proof of freshness, right?

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,110
I've realized my passion for cooking

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,190
and have wanted to learn since I was young.

15
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,950
My life is pretty much revolving around cooking.

16
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,840
I used to ask my grandma why she loved cooking.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,840
I don’t want to eat here. I want pizza.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,070
Grandma, that boy seems to be in a bad mood.

19
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,820
Yes, it seems so. What should we do, Prem?

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,870
How about we serve him Fried Pork Toast?

21
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,000
Good idea. Go ahead.

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,050
Wow, what’s that?

23
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,840
This is Fried Pork Toast.

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,050
Please try it. It’s delicious.

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,240
When a dish brings smiles to people,

26
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,240
it brings joy to the person who makes it.

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,760
This has become my greatest inspiration.

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,030
But it's not just about seeing people enjoying the food I cook;

29
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,100
it's also about being able to finally provide for my family.

[Faculty of Home Economics open for new enrollments

31
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,730
But I almost had to give up on my dream

32
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,550
because the tuition fees were so expensive.

33
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,800
I didn't know how many extra jobs I would have to take on to cover the fees.

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,590
I didn't want to burden my family further

35
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,360
by adding to their financial struggles to pay for my tuition fees.

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,830
You want to study there?

37
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,660
No, not at all.

38
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,890
(I’m dying to study there. I didn’t want to bother you.)

39
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,220
Even though you don’t want to, I want to enroll you in there.

40
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,240
Can I pay for it?

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,640
My grandma, who always speaks opposites, understands me best.

42
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,220
At that time,

43
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,380
I thought I could finally learn the culinary skills I'd always wanted.

- I could finally be on the path to become the greatest chef

45

46
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,360

50
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,680
Mother’s Day.

51
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,730
Ah, 12th of August.

52
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,980
Woah!

53
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,800
I got into here with a GED.

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,990

- I had to be patient. My day will arrive soon.

YEAR 3 - SEMESTER 1

59

All I got to do was debone chicken. Still far from my dream.

60
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,460
Gosh!

61
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,740
I’m now in the second semester of my third year.

62
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,720
This will finally be my day.

63
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,290
Wow, you’ve got so many things to buy.

64
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,870
So, did you finally make it to a real cooking class?

65
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,470
Took you what, three whole years?

66
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,530
Will you be fine?

67
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,190
But you should get something from your grandma.

68
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,440
You should be able to do it.

69
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,900
Or just get to wing it?

70
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,900
You certainly have a way with words.

71
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,570
Why limit yourself to working here in the market?

72
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,870
You're more suited to be a public speaker.

73
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,560
Ouch. That hurts.

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,140
Anyway, I hope you can get your hands on cooking soon.

75

Yes, I know.

I thought…

98
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,620
Thanks.

99

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,070

No.

Good.

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,850

00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,870
Mai.

127
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,700
Yes?

128
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,550
I’m hungry. I haven’t had anything since 6 PM yesterday.

129

Why are you still doing that IF thingy?

130

But I can eat now.

131
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,390
Well then, please eat a lot this morning.

132

You can wait at the table. I’ll bring your breakfast right up.

133

I’m hungry.

134

137
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,200
I don’t want it now.

138
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,650
But you said earlier that you were starving.

139
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,510
Why?

140
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,650
Did you suddenly lose your appetite seeing your dad?

141
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,720
I don’t want to join the table with you.

142

143

I’m not.

144
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,020
Good then.

145
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,280
If you refuse to eat here,

146
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,060
why not stay empty-stomached throughout the day?

147
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,520
Don't just skip meals because I’m around.

I’m the man of my word. I’m not like you.

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,360
What’s with that noise you’re making, Unky?

168
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,480
I’m craving all those foods they mentioned.

169
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,900
Can't stop picturing them in my head.

170
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,620
Alright,

171
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,890
Thai soups come in various types,

172
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,370
some with coconut milk, some without.

173
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,820
Today, you'll work in groups of three.

174
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,690
Your task is to create a Thai soup dish.

175
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,120
In the morning, outline your ideas with a picture and present them to me.

176
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,810
In the afternoon, bring your creation to life.

177
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,090
Any questions?

178
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,940
Today is the day I get to create my first dish in my class.

179
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,370
Change clothes!

180
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,480
Yes, Chef!

181
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,640
Remote!

182
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,060
Yes, Chef!

183
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,170
Popcorn!

184
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,730
Yes, Chef!

185
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,910
And the Super Monster Chef this week is…'

186
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:04,590
is…

187
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,180
Chef Chang Ma!

188
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,490
Yeah!

189
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,460
Dy, Unky…what should we make?

190
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,950
This time, we must be serious.

191
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,420
No play if we don’t want Prof. to snap at us again.

192
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,700
We have to give it our all because it's one of the paths to our dream

193
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,980
of becoming top chefs, just like in 'The Super Monster Chef' program

194
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,990
that all three of us enjoy watching together every Friday night.

195
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,670
Good then.

196
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,630
If you refuse to eat here, why not stay empty-stomached throughout the day?

197
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,060
Don't just skip meals because I’m around.

198
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,230
No matter what, I'm not eating today.

199
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,790
Just trying not to exert myself too much.

200
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,270
Save up some energy; the day will be over soon.

201
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,680
You okay there, Tossatis?

202
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,190
Feeling sleepy?

203
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,570
Sorry, Prof.

204
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,190
I've been teaching nothing but lectures; it might get a bit boring.

205
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,970
Come out here.

206
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,770
What is this thing?

207
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,190
Galangal.

208
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,900
But this doesn’t look like it.

209
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,700
This is the pot handle.

210
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,380
Give it to me. Let me draw it.

211
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,180
I’ve got this.

212
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,580
And what is this?

213
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,540
What…what is that?

214
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,210
I’m sorry.

215
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,430
Stop. Stop.

216
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,110
What’s so funny, 3B?

217
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,410
[Ball - Boon - Babe]

218
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,880
Great drawing. Looks so much like...

219
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,660
Like food?

220
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,870
Like wet garbage.

221
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,600
Why? Your drawing is so divine or something?

222
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,980
Huh?

223
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,430
Dum dum dum.

224
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,680
Damn.

225
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,330
So pretty.

226
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,860
So nice.

227
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,520
Merci.

228
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,220
Only Unky Class Repeaty has a good eye.

229
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,760
What the hell did you call me?

230
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,360
It might look good only in the picture.

231
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,090
Who knows if your food is as good?

232
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,270
We, 3B, have always been at the top of the class.

233
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,520
We haven't merely gotten by like you, Little Dynamo.

234
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,490
Know your place before belittling us.

235
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,390
You three should not attempt coconut milk curry.

236
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,130
Try making Clear Soup clear first.

237
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,500
Al dente.

238
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,150
If you're done with your drawing, go submit it to the professor.

239
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,610
Didn't you get enough love from your family?

240
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,920
Why pick on others?

241
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,430
Is that why you've become this kind of person?

242
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,790
What's your problem, you Pork Bone Soup?

243
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,700
- You Unagi, Bad Pork Bone Soup, You Khao Soi Gai!
-	Let’s get out of here.

244
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,630
Enough.

245
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,280
Press harder, Tossatis,

246
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,490
it might help shake off the drowsiness.

247
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,950
Yes, sir.

248
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,370
(Haven’t eaten anything, I have low energy.)

249
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,050
(Why do I have to use it for this?)

250
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,660
Okay, the patient is awake,

251
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,910
And you’re probably fully awake now too.

252
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,710
Go back to your seat.

253
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,060
Yes, sir..

254
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,960
(Activate Safe Mode, breathe slowly.)

255
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,080
(Do things in slow motion…)

256
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,110
(to save my body energy.)

257
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,110
Speed up, please.

258
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,940
Oi. Stop it. Where are you taking me?

259
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,420
Stop it.

260
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
And why here?

261
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,400
Why did you take me to the Medical faculty canteen?

262
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,240
Why here, Dy?

263
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,650
I’ve got something I want to introduce to you guys.

264
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,070
That is…

265
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,080
I want you to know my sweetheart.

266
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,680
Since when did you get yourself a sweetheart?

267
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,400
Where? Who’s the unlucky person?

268
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,470
Bite me.

269
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,470
There. Look.

270
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,220
His name is Fire.

271
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,140
What’s wrong?

272
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,420
I’m shy. I can’t make eye contact with him.

273
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,960
Is he really your sweetheart?

274
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,100
Yes…

275
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,460
in the future.

276
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,810
I like him.

277
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,200
His gaze can melt me.

278
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,340
If you like him, make a move!

279
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,270
You won't make any progress just standing here.

280
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,050
Seriously, Unky.

281
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,460
Make a move on him?

282
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,750
I can’t do it.

283
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,560
You don’t have a drink.

284
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,330
I'm worried your throat might get dry. I bought it for you.

285
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,300
Thanks.

286
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,120
But no, thanks.

287
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,920
Your name is Fire.

288
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,580
My name is Dynamite.

289
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,680
We know each other now.

290
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,980
Don’t follow me. I don’t know you.

291
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,600
Don’t say things you don’t mean.

292
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,680
I’m a nice person.

293
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,180
You’ll want to get to know me.

294
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,160
Hey, where are you going?

295
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,600
Don’t leave this drink.

296
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
It’ll be sad.

297
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,220
I’d run away too if I were him.

298
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,230
You can go order your food. I’ll save the table.

299
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,550
Thanks.

300
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,120
3 Deep Fried Pork Balls, please.

301
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Phew! Still plenty left.

302
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,210
Aunt Pom, I have Fried Veggies

303
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,750
and also Deep Fried Pork Balls.

304
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,420
All of them, please.

305
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,650
Including the crumbs. Sweep them all onto my plate.

306
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,780
Hey.

307
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,280
Hey!

308
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Why don’t you leave some for others?

309
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,020
What?

310
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,250
Coming late and complaining, huh?

311
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,290
You can choose something else to eat.

312
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,830
But I want those.

313
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,780
Ah, you want these Deep Fried Pork Balls too?

314
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,230
You want them, huh?

315
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,980
They look yummy, right?

316
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,230
They are big and hot.

317
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,890
Piping hot.

318
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,270
Freshly cooked Pork Balls.

319
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,540
If you want them, be here earlier next time.

320
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,740
Here. Keep the changes.

321
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,110
Wow. Really yummy.

322
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,720
You glutton!

323
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,000
Here. Have some. I’ve got extra for you.

324
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,230
I’m not eating.

325
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,480
Aren’t you hungry?

326
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,870
No.

327
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,400
What’s that sound?

328
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,710
A frog.

329
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,960
Ah, probably a wild one

330
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,830
Up to you.

331
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,570
Don’t be harsh on yourself just to spite your dad.

332
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,350
He’s not around. He’s not gonna know.

333
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,840
Have a bite. Come on.

334
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,900
My dad might not know,

335
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,940
but I’ll know in my heart.

336
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,630
That’s a heroic line.

337
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,020
Keep torturing yourself then, you pigheaded idiot.

338
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,020
Ooh.

339
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,410
Prem, let’s go eat somewhere else.

340
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,050
That prick snatched all the pork balls I wanted.

341
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,180
So annoying.

342
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,910
I hope he chokes on them.

343
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Give me a hand.

344
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,440
Come on!

345
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,620
I won't be tempted by your food. I should leave.

346
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,240
(Just go sit in the cool, quiet library. The day will pass by soon, Ten.)

347
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,060
No.

348
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,290
Please, no.

349
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,010
Students, the car broke down.

350
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,150
Could some of the male students help push the car, please?

351
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,770
You can do it.

352
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:57,100
You can do it.

353
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,780
Everyone.

354
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,580
You may start your group cooking now.

355
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Yes, sir!

356
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,740
Go!

357
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:36,480
It’s kinda soft and warm.

358
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,450
This kind of touch reminds me of something.

359
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,930
I'm not sure what it is, but it's making me feel good.

360
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,650
Unky!

361
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,450
You are extracting coconut milk, not getting an aroma massage.

362
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,670
It’s not time to enjoy it.

363
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,950
I enjoy this.

364
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,550
We should enjoy cooking.

365
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,630
It'll make our food delicious.

366
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,090
But we need to move faster.

367
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,590
Here. Add more water.

368
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,320
Oi!

369
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Sorry, I didn't realize it was hot water.

370
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,420
Are you okay?

371
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,190
I'm fine.

372
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,800
But I'm not!

373
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,200
Me neither.

374
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:29,190
Pass me another grated coconut. I'll make the milk quickly.

375
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,420
There's none left. I brought just enough.

376
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,970
This is bad. What do we do?

377
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,660
Use money. Hire someone to buy it.

378
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,120
We can't. There are various types of grated coconut.

379
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,900
We might get the wrong one.

380
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,290
What should we do then?

381
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,510
You guys start on other tasks first. I'll go buy it myself.

382
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,410
Unky, come and slice the chicken.

383
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,920
On it!

384
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,110
Ten, you’re not going to die here, are you?

385
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,310
Don’t make me talk.

386
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,810
I’m in Safe Mode.

387
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,570
Here, have a bite.

388
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,430
It smells good, doesn’t it?

389
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,430
It smells really good.

390
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,820
No!

391
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,050
Look, what’s the point of doing this?

392
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,370
Your dad’s not around to see.

393
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,370
Just have a bite.

394
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,720
None…of…your…business.

395
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,930
Suit yourself then.

396
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,240
Ten, Look!

397
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,850
Check out that girl.

398
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:44,440
Woah, backpack and tripods.

399
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,870
A girl who’s into cameras.

400
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,140
I think I've got a crush on her.

401
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,310
I'm heading out now.

402
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,460
I’ll find a seat to sit near her.

403
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,050
I want to be in her sight.

404
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,800
Bye.

405
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,340
Stuff that meatball in your mouth too!

406
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,600
Excuse me. Could you pass the ball back to us?

407
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,690
Damn it.

408
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,360
At this rate, I might fall just by standing up.

409
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,700
Just kick it to us.

410
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,530
Got weak knees, uncle?

411
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,220
Must be too much for an old man.

412
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,160
Is he okay?

413
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,830
You little rascals, if you ask for it!

414
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,930
Hey, watch out!

415
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,760
Shit!

416
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
Is he still breathing?

417
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,090
Don’t try to get up just yet.

418
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,240
Ouch.

419
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,490
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hit the ball at your head.

420
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,060
Let me check if you have a concussion.

421
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,590
Follow my fingers with your eyes.

422
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,490
Hey.

423
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,900
Your brain is not responsive now?

424
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
Coconut milk!

425
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,450
Do I look as pale as coconut milk?

426
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,860
Speed up.

427
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,400
Any group falling behind needs to speed up.

428
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,070
Goodness, where on earth is Prem?

429
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,690
I’m here!

430
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,590
Finally!

431
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,150
What held you up? Did you climb a palm tree for it?

432
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,130
I’ll explain later.

433
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,200
Put the chicken in the pot.

434
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Chicken’s in the pot now.

435
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,990
Raise the heat.

436
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
Time’s over!

437
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,920
Group 1, what’s your dish?

438
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,200
Green Curry, sir.

439
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,080
Group 2.

440
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,070
What kind of soup is this?

441
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,940
Spicy Mixed Veggies Soups with Prawns.

442
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,210
Nice color.

443
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:12,130
It tastes really great. I give it a 4.

444
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,570
Group 3.

445
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,570
This is ‘Nang Loi’ Red Curry.

446
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,760
A rare ancient delicacy.

447
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,080
It offers a flavorful taste profile—sweet, buttery, savory,

448
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,540
and a hint of spiciness.

449
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,500
Excellent choice. Very outstanding.

450
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,080
I’m sure some of your classmates have never heard of this dish before.

451
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,460
Thank you.

452
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,160
Excellent.

453
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,800
- Tom Kha Gai
- I'm not going to taste this dish.

454
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Regardless of how excellent this dish might be,

455
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,050
if it's not completed within the allocated time, I won’t evaluate it.

456
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,200
Although it might have a heavenly taste,

457
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,700
you failed to submit it on time.

458
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,220
It's now useless.

459
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,210
Gosh. That’s harsh.

460
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,210
But it might be too soft for them.

461
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,260
He still sucks and hasn’t improved at all.

462
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,500
I’m starting to doubt if his family truly owns a restaurant.

463
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,990
He does have one,

464
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,370
but it’s going under soon.

465
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,410
Going under, my ass!

466
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,340
Prem!

467
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,200
I don’t like to hear inappropriate language in my kitchen.

468
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,440
This was communicated to you all from day one.

469
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,880
I’ll make your group understand how to work as a team

470
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
and the importance of proficient task delegation.

471
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,700
Everyone in your group must help clean up the whole kitchen this evening.

472
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,820
Who kicked the ball at your head?

473
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,360
If I find that jerk, I’ll give him a lesson.

474
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Don’t get so ballsy, Dy.

475
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,780
It's better not to meet that man again.

476
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,020
I've washed countless dishes.

477
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,100
Look at my hands.

478
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,340
They're all red from irritation caused by the dishwasher.

479
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,340
They’re itchy all over.

480
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,340
Quit complaining, Unky.

481
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,390
My hands are all wrinkled up, just like my grandma's face.

482
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,120
Damn.

483
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,720
Fine. I'll handle the rest.

484
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,170
You should go and apply some balm on your hands.

485
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,150
You too, Dy.

486
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,680
Leave everything to me.

487
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,300
It’s okay. I can manage. I just needed to vent a bit.

488
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,940
Shit, the steel sponge got under my nail.

489
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,380
Where?

490
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,650
Unky, remove it for me.

491
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,470
Where?

492
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,150
Here.

493
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,150
Ouch.

494
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,510
Arggggggh!

495
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,770
You two can go.

496
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,200
I’ll carry this on for you.

497
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,720
Can we really go?

498
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,360
Yes. Just go.

499
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,220
Are you sure, pal?

500
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,870
I really wanted to help, but my hands are really too red.

501
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,950
If the steel sponge hadn’t gotten under my nail,

502
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,160
I could’ve helped you finish this task.

503
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,010
I’ll leave it to you then.

504
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,080
Um.

505
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,380
I probably have to give it to a dog.

506
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Do I really have to throw this out?

507
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,110
I put my heart and soul into it.

508
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,030
Smells good.

509
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,920
Hey, what the heck?

510
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,080
You!

511
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,140
How did you even get in here?

512
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,280
Smells so good.

513
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,300
Can I eat it?

514
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,630
No.

515
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,490
You're the reason I missed the dish submission time.

516
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,910
I lost group points and got stuck with dishwashing duty.

517
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,120
I got scolded and teased–all because of you.

518
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,520
Besides, I still feel dizzy even now.

519
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,880
I'm hungry.

520
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,680
Hey, you okay?

521
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,960
Did that scolding knock you out?

522
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,960
Here.

523
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,520
At first, I thought of giving it to a dog, but I couldn't find one.

524
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,990
Suddenly, this dog appeared.

525
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,780
Keep scolding.

526
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,220
You'll never understand unless you're as hungry as I am.

527
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,680
Excuse me, Master.

528
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,770
Kaffir lime leaves.

529
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,600
Red chilies.

530
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:45,140
Woohoo.

531
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,810
What are you doing?

532
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,810
Stretching.

533
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,570
(I’ve never seen anyone enjoy my food this much before.)

534
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:12,420
(So this is probably the joy of cooking that my grandma talked about.)

535
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,210
Unky.

536
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:27,600
Huh?

537
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,400
Should we really leave Prem to handle all the clean up alone?

538
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,060
We didn’t exactly leave him.

539
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,620
He asked us to leave.

540
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,060
He was done with your whiny voice.

541
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,740
I think we should go back and help him.

542
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,550
I don’t feel like leaving him to deal with that alone.

543
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,860
Alright. Whatever suits you. I’m fine to go back there.

544
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,490
Shall we?

545
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,170
I’m taking off first.

546
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,700
Hey! You little sly!

547
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,850
You're still around?

548
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,850
Are you waiting for me?

549
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,650
Waiting for you, my foot.

550
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,270
Move. You’re blocking my view.

551
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,010
Don’t be so rough.

552
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,220
What’s your view?

553
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,080
Ah.

554
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,790
Your little sis?

555
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,620
I’m an only child.

556
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,560
That’s my future girlfriend.

557
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,060
Future? That means it’s not happening yet.

558
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,460
Why not go sit with her?

559
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,330
You are so far away.

560
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,940
Shh.

561
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,440
How will she know?

562
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,700
Are you scared?

563
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,400
What a wimp.

564
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,840
You’re calling me a wimp!

565
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
You stay here.

566
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,400
I wait until you’re out of my way.

567
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,880
I don’t want any interruption.

568
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,470
You just talk the talk.

569
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,470
How about punching a punch?

570
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,470
Easy. Let’s keep it civil.

571
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,840
How can I make it up to you?

572
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
How about this?

573
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Go ask for her number for me.

574
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,220
Got it.

575
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,090
Woah.

576
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,690
He got it?

577
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,710
Woah.

578
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,670
You finished it all? It’s good, right?

579
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,820
No, it’s not…

580
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,750
Hey. You could’ve used a nicer word.

581
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,140
Why eat it all if it’s not good?

582
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,550
Spit it out. Spit it all out now.

583
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,360
Wait. Wait a minute. I was about to say

584
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,360
it is not just good, but great.

585
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,240
You cut me off and snapped at me.

586
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,430
It’s not the time to play on words.

587
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,490
Alright. I’ll make it up. Let me pay for the soup.

588
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,030
How much?

589
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,990
No need to.

590
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,090
I would’ve thrown it away anyway.

591
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,420
What? It’s almost 9.

592
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,630
You’re done here. Go. I need to finish up.

593
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,180
Let me help with your wound.

594
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,180
No, it’s alright. It’s a tiny cut.

595
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,670
It looks tiny but it might cut deeper than you think.

596
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,380
If it gets wet or exposed to germs, you could get tetanus.

597
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,820
Is that a treat? Are you a doctor?

598
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,010
Not one yet, just a third-year med student.

599
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,140
Alright. It’s done.

600
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
I put on a water-block bandage for now.

601
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,240
Just keep it away from water for a few days, and you’ll be fine.

602
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,280
I’m also in my third year.

603
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Why haven’t I seen you before?

604
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,590
Perhaps it just hasn't been our time to meet yet, Chef.

605
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,780
(Why is he smiling? I just said it without any real meaning)

606
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,850
(I didn’t actually want to meet him.)

607
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,230
[Grandma]

608
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,690
What’s up, Grandma?

609
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,240
When will you be home, Prem?

610
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,910
Why are you coming back home late?

611
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,660
Today I got to cook in class for the first time, Grandma.

612
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,640
I need to clean everything up.

613
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,870
I’ll be heading home soon.

614
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:29,290
Really? How great. You finally got to cook.

615
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:35,260
Grandma, someone ate my food today and even smiled.

616
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,260
Really? Tell me about it.

617
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,170
I’ll tell you when I’m home.

618
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,170
Gotta go now.

619
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,030
Good evening, Mother.

620
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,030
Why are you home late?

621
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,350
I had a paper to work on with my friends.

622
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,450
Please excuse me, Mother.

623
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,980
Jane, my dear. Here I am.

624
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,730
I’ve got your number here.

625
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,010
Hello. How are you?

626
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,010
:	Hey there.

627
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,410
Damn it. How come it’s you?

628
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,220
You’re calling me, so it’s me who’s answering, babe.

629
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,630
But I called Jane’s number that you gave me.

630
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,610
Don’t tell me that you…

631
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,000
Yep, that’s my number.

632
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,160
You pickled cabbage. You tricked me!!

633
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Fire, what’s all that noise about?

634
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,860
Nothing, Mother. Just chatting with a friend.

635
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,910
You’re so sweet to your mom. How cute.

636
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,360
Gosh, you’re just my type!

637
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,500
Stop it. You rat poison, saggy muscles, dirty chopsticks,

638
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,480
musty-smelling clothes, non-conductive metal, bitter cucumber, fartass!

639
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,630
Ooh, love it!

640
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,240
Dig in. What are you waiting for?

641
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,240
Grandma, you go first. The elder should have it first.

642
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,300
Oh, no no no.

643
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,540
I’ve tried this dish before. You go first.

644
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,590
I've had it before too. You go first.

645
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,460
I also….

646
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,270
None of you have to try it.

647
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,960
Wait a minute.

648
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,820
Don’t get sulky that easily. Put it back.

649
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,790
Let’s make it fair.

650
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,900
Let’s taste it together at the same time.

651
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,900
Okay?

652
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,930
Alright.

653
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,850
One.

654
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,350
Two.

655
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,100
Three.

656
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,760
How is it? Good?

657
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,420
Please take care of this place for me.

658
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,820
It’s my time to leave this world.

659
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,260
Grandma! Write a will for me before you leave.

660
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,170
Pang, you! How could you jinx me?

661
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,810
This is not what we agreed on.

662
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,850
My grandma is quite the actress.

663
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,850
I almost called to reserve a funeral place for you.

664
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:05,040
Are you having so much fun? Teaming up to prank me.

665
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,350
We saw you wake up early to make this hearty dish.

666
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,880
I just wanted to tease you.

667
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,890
Whose idea was it?

668
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,300
Why'd you tell him?

669
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,330
I didn’t. I just pointed.

670
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,330
Remember, you tricked me.

671
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,810
If you’re in trouble, don’t come asking for my help.

672
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,740
So, is it good?

673
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,360
Honestly, I didn’t focus on the taste.

674
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,790
That’s right. You only focused on pranking him.

675
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,060
Yes, Grandma.

676
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,620
But I think I’m better at making this dish.

677
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,620
I know.

678
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,540
It’s good. It’s really good.

679
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,210
Listen. This really tastes good.

680
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:56,360
It’s worth every baht I paid for your course.

681
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:02,290
I’m running late. I have to leave for school now.

682
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:03,240
Go.

683
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,770
Don’t forget to pay the tuition fees and the cram school fees.

684
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,710
You’re always absent-minded and clumsy.

685
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,450
I won’t forget to do so. I’m off to school now.

686
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,320
Great.

687
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,960
Come on.

688
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,610
You go to.

689
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,320
You also have class, don’t you? Go.

690
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,000
Yummy.

691
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:42,410
I almost forgot.

692
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,010
Yes, Professor?

693
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,200
Come to my office when you get here.

694
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,700
There’s something I need to talk to you about.

695
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,200
I’ll be there.

696
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:13,520
So, you stayed up late because you couldn’t finish washing the dishes, right?

697
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,680
Yes.

698
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,900
And you weren’t alone,

699
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,980
you brought an outsider into the building?

700
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,410
Uh…

701
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,260
Tell me the truth.

702
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,840
Well,

703
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,350
That man was about to pass out because he hadn’t eaten all day.

704
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:36,280
He was in pretty bad shape, so I let him in to eat.

705
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,670
I didn’t know what else to do, and I didn’t realize it was too late.

706
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,590
But you know, rules are rules.

707
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:48,590
Students are not allowed to use the kitchen lab after 9 PM

708
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:51,840
unless there is a special event or they have obtained advanced permission.

709
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,860
Otherwise, the kitchen lab will end up unorganized.

710
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,300
Nevertheless, there will be a punishment for violating the rules.

711
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,300
Be prepared for it.

712
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,940
What a troublemaker!

713
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,010
I shouldn’t have helped you.

714
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,520
Medical Faculty? I’ll see you there.

715
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,900
Do you know this man?

716
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,140
Thank you.

717
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,260
Do you know this man?

718
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,070
Excuse me. Do you happen to know this man?

719
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,860
I used to see him in that building.

720
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,480
That building?

721
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:33,900
Yes.

722
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,190
Thank you so much.

723
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,070
Chef!

724
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,670
Take this back.

725
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:42,910
Oh.

726
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,550
It’s my wallet.

727
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,160
I didn’t even realize I left it behind.

728
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,010
Thank you so much. I was about to meet you.

729
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:50,600
Stop.

730
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,440
Don’t say a word.

731
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,310
Don’t come to see me.

732
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,310
You are a jinx.

733
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,690
Me?

734
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,020
Ever since I met you, it’s been nothing but trouble.

735
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,530
Yesterday, I got hit in the head and knocked over.

736
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:03,290
Today, my professor called me in for a scolding.

737
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,210
I have to do the dishwashing duty for everyone for a week,

738
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,220
thanks to you!

739
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,650
From now on, I hope we never have to meet again.

740
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,630
Goodbye, forever.

741
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,780
Wait.

742
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,780
Hands off me.

743
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,360
Hands off.

744
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,770
But…

745
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,770
can you teach me how to cook?

746
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,730
Cook?

747
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,510
Didn’t anything I said earlier get through your brain at all?

748
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:28,510
I won’t teach you. You are a jinx. I don’t want to be near you.

749
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,230
Me, a jinx?

750
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,490
The ball incident was purely an accident.

751
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,910
And you getting punishment, how was I the reason?

752
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,430
Forget it.

753
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,210
I’m happy now. I got to yell at you.

754
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,130
But I’m not happy.

755
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,450
Chef…

756
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:54,020
Teach me how to cook.

757
00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:03,740
Please.

758
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,610
What are you doing? Get up.

759
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,680
I’m on my knees, begging you to teach me how to cook.

760
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,260
No!

761
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,200
Playing hard to get, huh?

762
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,200
Chef,

763
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,060
try this Tom Kha Gai. I made it myself.

764
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,160
I’m not gonna try it.

765
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,030
Take it with you. I called this table mine. You cannot sit here.

766
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:34,700
Just one bite. I want to know my cooking ability.

767
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,390
No. I didn’t know if you put something weird in it.

768
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,900
Are you trying to get back at me?

769
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:45,470
Do I look like an evil spiteful guy?

770
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,700
You’ll leave me alone if I have it, right?

771
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,750
Um.

772
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,170
One bite and that’s it.

773
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,100
Chef,

774
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,360
let me add some fish sauce for a great flavor.

775
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:25,990
It’s too much!!!

776
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,370
Too salty that I might as well have my kidney removed.

777
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,750
You said no prank.

778
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,280
What in the world did you put in it?

779
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,970
It’s not a prank.

780
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,570
This is the best I can cook. That’s why I need you to teach me.

781
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:40,520
Please, Chef.

782
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:45,420
But it’s strangely tasting good in a way.

783
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,930
You went back on your word very quickly.

784
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,120
Why not have it all then?

785
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,490
But we agreed on one bite and that’s it.

786
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,030
Just one hour.

787
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,280
Please teach me.

788
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,760
One hour only. Please.

789
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,510
No, I won’t teach you.

790
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,850
Don’t pester me.

791
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,440
Chef, please teach me.

792
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,720
Chef!

793
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,490
I’m not giving up easily.

794
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:27,430
For heaven's sake, why did they use these small bowls for all the ingredients?

795
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,530
When will I ever finish this?

796
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,630
I’ll give you a hand, Chef.

797
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,070
What are you doing here, Doc?

798
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,070
I’ll wash them all for you,

799
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,220
but in return, you must teach me.

800
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,190
If you're serious about learning to cook,

801
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,440
why not check out YouTube?

802
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,320
There are loads of tutorials there.

803
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,530
It's not the same.

804
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,370
Please teach me.

805
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,420
Charge me whatever you think is fair.

806
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,180
1 million.

807
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:48,600
1 million?

808
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,090
Stop it!

809
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,950
Why are you so difficult to convince?

810
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,530
I’m not being difficult.

811
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,220
I refused to teach you not because I called you a jinx.

812
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,970
It’s because I lack the capability.

813
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:03,790
I’m the least skilled in my class.

814
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:05,190
I can’t teach anyone.

815
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,920
If there’s one thing I’m good at, it's the dishwashing task.

816
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,260
But your Tom Kha Gai was really delicious.

817
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,260
You were just hungry at the time.

818
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,410
Everything was delicious in your mouth.

819
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,210
No, it was the taste that I…

820
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:16,850
No.

821
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,240
I’m not gonna teach you. Stop bugging me.

822
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,690
Okay.

823
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,780
Fine.

824
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,450
Give me your hand.

825
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,450
What are you doing?

826
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,260
This is my number.

827
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,880
Call me when you change your mind.

828
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,310
Are you aiming for these jumbo numbers to stay forever here?

829
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:50,310
Yes.

830
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,670
I have something to tell you.

831
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:04,090
I’m trying to find a Tom Kha Gai recipe

832
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:07,410
that tastes exactly like the one we had together.

833
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,420
There are 24 hours in a day.

834
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,780
Your medical studies take up 16 hours,

835
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,910
and you have less than 4 hours for sleep.

836
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,310
And now you want to learn cooking?

837
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,700
Don’t you ever want to cook for someone you love?

838
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,700
What does he want to show up before you this often?

839
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,730
He pesters me to teach him how to cook.

840
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:33,640
But I don’t want to do it.

841
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,560
What? You lost 50,000?

842
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,160
Please help me.

843
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,410
I’m ready to teach you now, Doc.

844
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,960
Watch it.

845
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,670
I'll charge you 50,000 baht for my cooking course.

846
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,170
Deal.
