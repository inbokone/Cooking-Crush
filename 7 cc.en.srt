Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,980
You took someone else’s techniques to teach him.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,990
How could he not be jealous?

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,650
There won't be any difference when we eat it.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,540
You didn’t like it because you’re jealous of him.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,230
I’ll go check on some other things.

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,600
I think you should use the last cooking session to decide

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,640
whether to go further with him or stop right here.

12
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,420
Sometimes, people get carried away without even realizing it.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,940
Why can he stay, and I can’t?

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,300
They think I’ll become unfocused.

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,010
Hi, Dr. Ten.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,230
Hi.

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,480
Are you here to see Prem?

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,990
Sorry, he’s busy today.

19
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,990
We need to shoot our audition clip.

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,710
Mind if I stay?

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,890
I want to observe and learn.

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,970
I’ll make sure to keep quiet.

23
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,000
They think I’ll become unfocused.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,380
Are you two a thing?

25
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,630
If not, then he can’t distract you.

26
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,160
Or actually, you are?

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,530
Uh…let’s all go together.

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,950
When it comes to pasta, fresh pasta contains more water than dried pasta.

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,420
So its texture is soft and tender when eating.

30
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,580
It pairs wonderfully with creamy and buttery sauces.

31
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,990
Wow. What a wealth of knowledge.

32
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,190
But if you choose to use dried pasta,

33
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,630
it has a firmer and stickier texture,

34
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,860
allowing it to hold the sauce better.

35
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,330
Oh, what a crystal-clear presentation we have here.

36
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,450
For Capellini or Angel Hair,

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,420
the shape of pasta is like this

38
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,610
which is suitable to use with mild-flavored sauce

39
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,000
so that the pasta and the sauce don’t overpower each other.

40
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,610
Wowza, truly groundbreaking, advanced techniques.

41
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,390
For the right and ideal texture of cooked pasta, it should be 'Al Dente,'

42
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,630
with cooking time around…

43
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,850
2-3 minutes.

44
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,790
Oh, it’s right here on the pack.

45
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,370
Doc, can I have a word with you?

46
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,620
Doc, please I beg you.

47
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,750
Can you go home first?

48
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,270
I can’t really concentrate with you around.

49
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,710
Okay, Chef. I apologize.

50
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,020
I just can’t help doing that.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,330
Please go. Let me finish this audition clip.

52
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,330
I’ll call you as soon as it’s over.

53
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,150
Okay, Chef. I’ll wait for your call.

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,230
Basil.

67
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,980
Basil.

68
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,080
Here it is.

69
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,900
Why do you want to make pesto sauce?

70
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,220
Besides Thai dishes, that’s the first recipe I learned how to make.

71
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,560
It pairs well with various things.

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,670
We can have it with bread,

73
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,960
pasta,

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
or even grilled meat.

75
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,970
I think the simplicity that offers such variety should be a great choice.

76
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,480
Don’t you think?

77
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,100
Actually pesto sauce may look easy, but it isn’t that easy.

78
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,370
Like you.

79
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,500
(Why is he comparing me with being easy?)

80
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,720
Italian Basil gives a true Italian flavor,

81
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
especially in pesto sauce.

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,800
For that, you should use Genovese basil.

83
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,350
Look at it; it's dark green with long leaves,

84
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,350
spicy, and aromatic.

85
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,800
There are various types of basil,

86
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
like Lettuce Leaf Basil.

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,490
That kind is lighter in color than this one and offers a sweet flavor,

88
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,070
commonly used in dishes like bruschetta, fish, or chicken wraps.

89
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,500
I see.

90
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Usually, I use only Thai Basil as I can’t find this type of Basil in the fresh market.

91
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,870
This one, right?

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,550
But we’re gonna use this one today.

93
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,370
Did you know that in the past, in Italy,

94
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,660
people placed basil in front of their houses as a symbol of love and good intentions?

95
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,780
If you see basil at the front door,

96
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,940
it means the house is open to welcoming love.

97
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:08,000
If I give you the basil I grow, will you put it in front of your house?

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,630
Do you mean…

99
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,730
Uh…

100
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,820
(Please, don’t say it.)

101
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,710
I just want you to give me a chance.

102
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,690
(Hold on. Is he flirting with me?)

103
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,950
Well I…

104
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,540
It’s okay, Prem.

105
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,370
You don’t need to give me your answer now.

106
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,130
Please take time to think about it.

107
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,490
(What? He doesn’t even give me a chance to reject him.)

108
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,110
I think we’ve got everything.

109
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,730
Let’s check these out.

110
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,580
Let’s go.

111
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,580
We need to talk.

112
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,430
What are you doing?

113
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,420
When your friends asked about our relationship,

114
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,360
why did you change the subject like that?

115
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,130
My friends were all there.

116
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,910
Your friends or who else, exactly?

117
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,160
It’s not that. I didn’t want them to tease me.

118
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,750
I’m upset with you right now.

119
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,440
Can you accept my apology? I’m not good at patching up.

120
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,630
An apology alone isn’t enough. Do something more to make it up to me.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,810
I’m sorry, Doc.

122
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,640
I’m sorry, sorry, sorry.

123
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,990
I want to know how you feel.

124
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,760
Are our feelings mutual?

125
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,570
You keep avoiding the topic and not discussing it.

126
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,430
Instead, you seem to care about someone else.

127
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,680
I’m not the only one who catches feelings, right?

128
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,950
Is it clear now? You’re not the only one.

129
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,940
Chef.

130
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,670
Why does he have to be this cute?

131
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,670
When will he finish his audition clip?

132
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,670
I want to meet him so bad.

133
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:55,000
And this is spaghetti with pesto sauce, our top dish.

134
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,910
Cut.

135
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
I think this should be good enough.

136
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,980
But you can check if you’re okay with this.

137
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,310
No need to.

138
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,590
If you think it’s good, I’m sure it’s good.

139
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,220
I’m hungry. I want to eat it now.

140
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,070
Ooh, yum.

141
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,140
We humble juniors are immensely grateful to you.

142
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,970
Thank you.

143
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,620
It’s my pleasure. I’m having fun too.

144
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,350
This makes me feel like when I first joined the show.

145
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,730
Also,

146
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,340
I’m happy to help.

147
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,680
Hello, Chef.

148
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,390
(Hello, Doc. Where are you?)

149
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,670
(I finished cooking for the audition clip. I’ll bring it for you to try.)

150
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,430
I’m at the 24-hour cafe.

151
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,190
I'm seated at the table in front of the stairs.

152
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,970
Hurry. I miss you so much.

153
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,970
Okay. Ouch!

154
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,380
It’s all on the floor.

155
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,940
Gosh, Prem.

156
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,850
Sorry, Doc. I was too clumsy.

157
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,310
I barely have any of this left for you.

158
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,380
Don’t worry about it. I already had coffee.

159
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,050
But I haven’t eaten anything yet.

160
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,290
I thought you were waiting to eat with me.

161
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,780
It’s just a cup of coffee.

162
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,270
Oi, I’m hungry.

163
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,270
I’m hungry, really hungry.

164
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,270
My stomach feels like it's eating itself.

165
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,990
If you don’t believe me, you can feel my stomach.

166
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,450
Oi, Chef.

167
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,290
Drop the act. One coffee, really?

168
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,700
What about this croissant right here?

169
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,670
Oh, you saw it.

170
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,660
Come on.

171
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,480
Are you mad at me

172
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,120
No.

173
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,370
Don’t be mad at me. Please don’t.

174
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,150
- Don’t stop.
- Please.

175
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,790
I don’t want you to stop yet.

176
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,410
I’m sorry. Accept this as my apology.

177
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,630
Please.

178
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,890
Enough, Doc.

179
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,390
I’m not that mad. I just wanted you to do that too.

180
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,970
It’s cute.

181
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,800
Well then, sit back down.

182
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,370
I’ll go order something for you.

183
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,450
Here you are.

184
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,980
Soft and sweet pancakes.

185
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,970
Just like me, your soft and sweet soulmate.

186
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,000
Sorry.

187
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,980
(What happened in the front yard, you okay with it?)

188
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,220
What’s up, Doc?

189
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,330
Nothing.

190
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,730
I just…

191
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,630
tried to pick this pen cap.

192
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,800
Hey, Chef.

193
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,960
What are you doing?

194
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,640
I’m using my feet…

195
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,420
to get this.

196
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,250
I thought you were giving me the inviting signal.

197
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,390
What signal?

198
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,620
To kiss.

199
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,410
What?

200
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,070
Don’t you want to kiss me?

201
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,990
Uh…

202
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,590
But I want to kiss you.

203
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,360
How about we go to…

204
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,010
together?

205
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,410
Hey, people up there, keep it down, will you?

206
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,990
I don’t think this spot is safe. What should we do?

207
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460
I don’t know.

208
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,410
Do you want to continue?

209
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,830
I don’t think this spot is safe either.

210
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,180
Let’s split here.

211
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,400
Do you want to continue?

212
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:28,730
I think we should stop here. Don’t try further.

213
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,710
Okay.

214
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,000
We’re not going to continue, are we?

215
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,370
Sorry, Chef.

216
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,680
I did that on impulse.

217
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,000
I’m sorry too, Doc. I kept asking for more.

218
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,460
I feel bad.

219
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,680
But you’re not at fault.

220
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,980
We should blame Dopamine, Epinephrine, and Serotonin.

221
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,120
Hm?

222
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,880
Those are hormone names.

223
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Dopamine is a happiness chemical,

224
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,970
Epinephrine is the adrenaline that makes our heart race and excites us,

225
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,180
while Serotonin affects our behavior,

226
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,370
making us fight against strong resistance within our body.

227
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,410
That sounds quite scientific.

228
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,160
In simpler words,

229
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,130
these are the actions of being crazy in love.

230
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,930
I want to see you, look at your face, and spend every bit of time with you.

231
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,350
I also feel the same.

232
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,760
The same?

233
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,250
So our feelings are mutual.

234
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,730
That means I can officially hit on you now.

235
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,940
Seriously, Doc.

236
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,520
We kissed passionately earlier.

237
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,720
We’ve gone past that step.

238
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,760
Well then, shall we continue?

239
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,740
Jane, I’ve got more drinks for you.

240
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,530
Thanks.

241
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,950
Which one do you want?

242
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,600
Just water.

243
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,860
Is something bothering you?

244
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,960
No, I’m fine.

245
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,430
If you're thinking about him, give him a call.

246
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,590
Don't just sneakily look around for him like this.

247
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,380
What are you talking about? I’m not thinking about him.

248
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,370
Just be honest and admit it.

249
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,940
I have something to tell you honestly too.

250
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,590
Hm?

251
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,980
What is it?

252
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,370
I think this is the last time I’ll have this Shabu meal with you.

253
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,200
My date doesn’t like me doing this.

254
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,880
What? You already have a date? Who is it?

255
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,410
Who is it?

256
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,100
Go ask for her number for me.

257
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,980
Excuse me. I’d like to know about cameras.

258
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,530
Can I have your number?

259
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Her name is Bell.

260
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I met her before you.

261
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,580
She’s also from my faculty.

262
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,940
And you go out with me? Is Bell okay with this?

263
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,970
Bell has known about you all along.

264
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,770
Is she okay with you seeing me?

265
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,730
At first, we were just friends.

266
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,770
When you made a move on me, I gave myself a shot to get to know you.

267
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,360
But there was a time when we briefly stopped seeing each other, remember?

268
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,350
Um.

269
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,830
I started to open up to Bell.

270
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,580
So…

271
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,680
You and Bell were friends.

272
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,000
Then, I approached you.

273
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,980
Right?

274
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,640
And there was a period of time that we didn’t see each other.

275
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,380
But we are back together now.

276
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,690
When did you date Bell?

277
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,080
Actually, I've just started dating her recently.

278
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,520
I apologize for not mentioning it sooner.

279
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,290
I actually know that you are not that serious about me.

280
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,910
You're still hesitant to accept it and concerned about your mother, right?

281
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,350
Are you sure? Do you think that’s what I am?

282
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,570
Fire,

283
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,570
I think you should stop denying what you truly feel.

284
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,630
Relationships are complex as they are;

285
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,980
there's no need to further complicate your feelings.

286
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,290
Take a moment to hear your own thoughts and understand what you really want.

287
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,890
Try to find what brings you happiness too.

288
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,980
This kind of decision is entirely yours to make.

289
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,090
No one can force you.

290
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,450
If you are afraid, you'll remain as you are now.

291
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,550
Don’t be sad. Go ahead.

292
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,960
I want to talk to you about your grandson.

293
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,420
What did Prem do?

294
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:42,780
I think your grandson and my son are secretly dating.

295
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,360
Really? Are they, really?

296
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,150
Actually,

297
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,120
it’s not wrong if they want to go out together.

298
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,990
But I’m more concerned about my son’s studies.

299
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,680
Last semester, he nearly aced all his subjects with straight A's.

300
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,600
But this semester, his grades started to drop.

301
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,770
His GPA has now fallen to around the low 3s.

302
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,220
Because he’s putting more effort into being with your grandson.

303
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,920
He’s lost his concentration on his studies.

304
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,190
As a father,

305
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,380
I don’t want to delve into the details of how exactly I feel

306
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,420
and what action I expect you to take.

307
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,650
I see.

308
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,370
I understand where you’re coming from,

309
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,710
and I apologize for what Prem has done that has caused your concerns.

310
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,610
I’m sorry.

311
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,930
That’s all I’m here to say.

312
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,930
I look forward to your cooperation.

313
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,800
I’ll see myself out.

314
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,970
Goodbye.

315
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,980
Prem, we need to talk.

316
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,060
Come sit here.

317
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,470
Sit down.

318
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,670
Grandma, hear me out.

319
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,960
It wasn’t my intention.

320
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,660
If it wasn’t your intention, how did such a thing happen?

321
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,490
Pang cried in front of me; I had to help.

322
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,070
What does it have to do with Pang that you are dating his son?

323
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,370
What?

324
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,420
Are you secretly dating him?

325
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,500
Are you?

326
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,330
Hold on, Grandma.

327
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,210
What did he say to you?

328
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,460
He said you were secretly dating his son,

329
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,010
causing his son's academic performance to drop

330
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,560
since he learned cooking with you.

331
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,500
That’s it?

332
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,700
That’s it.

333
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,370
So?

334
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:55,060
Are you dating his son?

335
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,340
Right?

336
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,600
No. We haven’t started dating yet.

337
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,850
So you have feelings for him, right?

338
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,580
Right? Answer me.

339
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,990
If you like him, go for it. What's there to be afraid of?

340
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,250
Here's my advice.

341
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,250
Keep dating him on the down low, don't let his father know.

342
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,620
But make sure to tell your man not to let this relationship mess with his studies.

343
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,400
When you're dating, you should be pushing each other up,

344
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,930
not dragging each other down the hill.

345
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,380
I'm not OK with that!

346
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,280
Are you really okay with me going out with him?

347
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,830
Why shouldn’t I?

348
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,660
I thought you didn’t approve of him from what I saw how you treated him.

349
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,650
Are you here today too?

350
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,060
Dr. Ten regularly jogs in this area every morning.

351
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,780
You’re busy? Fine, let’s talk later.

352
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,070
No, I was just trying to find the right time to talk to you about this matter.

353
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,260
Just that.

354
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,620
Are we cool?

355
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,880
I think you should stop denying what you truly feel.

356
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,750
Relationships are complex as they are;

357
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,000
there's no need to further complicate your feelings.

358
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,650
Take a moment to hear your own thoughts and understand what you really want.

359
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,760
This kind of decision is entirely yours to make.

360
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,840
No one can force you.

361
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,010
If you are afraid, you'll remain as you are now.

362
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,450
Did I really can’t accept my feelings?

363
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,010
Do I really like him?

364
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,920
Damn.

365
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
What is he doing?

366
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,220
Metha.

367
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,160
Ten didn’t answer.

368
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,690
Metha’s phone is busy.

369
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,720
Dynamite?

370
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
I’m not gonna call you.

371
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,620
Shit! Damn my fingers.

372
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,150
What’s up? What do you want to talk about?

373
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,880
Me?

374
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,140
Do I want to talk to you?

375
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,430
Bite me.

376
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,700
Wait. Are you drunk?

377
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,900
Who’s drunk? Are you crazy?

378
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,570
I’m not drunk.

379
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,050
Look.

380
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,970
A drunk man can’t stand up straight like this.

381
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,290
Plus, I can dance.

382
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,410
Bang, bang.

383
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,560
This is liquor.

384
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,770
You bring liquor in this place?

385
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,880
Shhh.

386
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,370
Keep it down.

387
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,520
Can’t you just keep it to yourself?

388
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,220
I’m not keeping it down. What will you do with me, Firefy?

389
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,840
Mind your manor.

390
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,770
Manners.

391
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,690
Yeah, that.

392
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,390
You called me out for having no manners,

393
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,650
yet you bring booze inside this place.

394
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,520
Where did you leave your manners?

395
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,520
You’re asking for trouble, Mr. Good Mannered.

396
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,480
Not just good-mannered, but good-hearted.

397
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,410
Really?

398
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,700
How’s that?

399
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,920
I made you speechless, right?

400
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,490
You shouldn’t have done such a thing.

401
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:17,390
I sincerely apologize. It was impulsive, without much thought.

402
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,090
I'm truly sorry.

403
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,230
Fine.

404
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,850
Anyway, what’s wrong with you?

405
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,150
I don't know what's wrong with me either.

406
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,450
I'm confused and completely lost, you know.

407
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,950
I don't understand why I feel this way or why I've become like this.

408
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,850
Why do I sit here alone, hearing my own thoughts?

409
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,450
I don't know exactly what these feelings are. I don't have anyone to call and ask.

410
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,450
Do you get it? Do you get me?

411
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,330
How terrible are my feelings right now?

412
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,820
I don’t get it.

413
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,460
No one understands me.

414
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,630
Where’s my booze?

415
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,610
Hold up.

416
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,100
Let go of me.

417
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,860
Give it to me.

418
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,840
Hey!

419
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,550
Hey!!!

420
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,090
I don’t know what you are talking about yet.

421
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,310
You.

422
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,240
Why did you dodge me at the supermarket?

423
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,600
You didn’t want to see me, did you?

424
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,030
Listen to me.

425
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,820
Listen and remember.

426
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,970
Regardless of how much I say I don’t want to see you,

427
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,010
you

428
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,000
have

429
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,380
no rights

430
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,520
to walk away…

431
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,570
You're not making any sense.

432
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,570
I'm not going to talk to you anymore.

433
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,690
Fire.

434
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,020
Firefy.

435
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,000
Hey.

436
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,420
You dozed off?

437
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,860
Oi. My back hurts like hell.

438
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,980
I might have back pain forever from this.

439
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,400
You got back together with Jane,

440
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,790
so I’ve already gotten out of the way.

441
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,960
What’s with you all of a sudden?

442
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,420
Fire doesn’t suit you.

443
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,760
You should be named Fool.

444
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,140
What a fool!

445
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,550
Why do you always make me worry?

446
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,100
Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

447
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,310
I’m taking a leak.

448
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,590
You can’t do it right here.

449
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,000
But I want to let it go so badly.

450
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,570
No, not here. Hold it in.

451
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,340
Just a bit.

452
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,380
Not right there.

453
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,000
Just a bit.

454
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,940
Come here.

455
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,970
Come on. Just a bit. I can’t hold it anymore.

456
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,420
We’re almost there.

457
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,910
- Just a bit. Let me go.
- Hold it in.

458
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,640
Use your hand to block it.

459
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,100
Let go of me.

460
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,530
No, we’re nearly there.

461
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,000
Oi.

462
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,990
Thanks.

463
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,190
Not here.

464
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,790
Are you done?

465
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,810
No.

466
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,840
Do it quickly.

467
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,500
If you’re in a rush, help me pee.

468
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,960
I’m done here.

469
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,370
Goodbye.

470
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,210
No, no!

471
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,890
You can’t puke here.

472
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,260
Swallow it back in.

473
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,760
You can’t puke here.

474
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
How are you?

475
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,680
Feel better now?

476
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
What is there to be better?

477
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
You can’t crash here.

478
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,090
Let me. It’s comfy.

479
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,630
Hey. Walk straight.

480
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,720
What a big burden.

481
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,300
Just sleep and get sober before going home.

482
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,920
I’m off now.

483
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,270
What the hell is this? Let go of me.

484
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,090
I want to have you by my side, Dynamite.

485
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,190
Me too, Fy.

486
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,990
Hello, Chef. Where are you now?

487
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,200
You’re almost here?

488
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,400
I’m hungry

489
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,720
and also miss you.

490
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,130
I brought you a bunch of things to eat.

491
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,310
It should definitely satisfy your hunger.

492
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,250
Why are you doing that?

493
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,880
That should be me asking.

494
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,870
The other night, I saw you and…

495
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,120
your companion in the front yard.

496
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,370
Are you still hanging out with him?

497
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,370
It doesn’t concern you.

498
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,960
Can you not interfere with my private matters?

499
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,810
Private matters?

500
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,950
You spent time on stupid cooking lessons.

501
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,980
What about your studies? Are you ditching them now?

502
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,570
I never sacrifice my studying time for cooking.

503
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,960
But your grades are dropping.

504
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,560
Didn’t you say you wanted to be in med school so you could treat your mother?

505
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,550
Where’s that passion of yours gone?

506
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,680
If being in love makes your life go downhill, you'd better put an end to it.

507
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,590
No.

508
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,100
If you can’t come to your senses,

509
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,890
you can never save anyone.

510
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,560
You couldn’t save Mom too.

511
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,520
Ten!

512
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,930
Stop getting sidetracked already, Ten.

513
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,220
Chef.

514
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,290
Chef.

515
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,740
Chef!

516
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,810
Chef!

517
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,810
I knew you heard that.

518
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,930
I want to explain.

519
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,300
No need to, Doc.

520
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,700
I heard and it’s all clear to me.

521
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,700
We have no further cooking sessions anyway.

522
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Don’t come see me again.

523
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,720
Listen to me first. I don’t want us to be like this.

524
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Neither do I!

525
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,850
But I don’t want your life to go downhill because of me.

526
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,460
You know what?

527
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,980
Ever since you came into my life,

528
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,230
I’ve felt like I’m on cloud nine.

529
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:28,710
But after realizing that my happiness costs you everyone,

530
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,980
it’s tearing me apart.

531
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,990
I don’t want to feel this way.

532
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,440
How about we take some time apart from each other?

533
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,920
I’m going to prove that what we have is not useless.

534
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,450
And I won’t make you shed tears again.

535
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,340
Can you wait for me?

536
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,860
Holy shit.

537
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,130
How did I wind up here?

538
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,380
Shit. Why am I naked?

539
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,640
Damn Fire.

540
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,470
That was a dream.

541
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,140
What a relief. That was a dream. I feel no pain.

542
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,120
It must really be a dream.

543
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,020
What’s with you?

544
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,970
You are still acting weird even after sober?

545
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,640
You are here for real?

546
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,820
Then last night, you and me, we…

547
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,400
Your foul shirt.

548
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,140
You threw up on yourself, remember now?

549
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,020
Fool.

550
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,590
My name is Fire.

551
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,830
I cleaned that for you, you Fool!

552
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,830
Why are you here?

553
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,790
You called me to be here last night.

554
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,560
And you kept whining nonstop and talking gibberish.

555
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,530
You were so wasted.

556
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,530
I had to carry you up here to sleep.

557
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,020
That was all there was to it, right?

558
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,460
No.

559
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,160
You were here, right?

560
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,950
Then you wanted to pee, the next second, you asked for water.

561
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,110
I had to carry you up and down, back and forth.

562
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,520
My back hurts like hell.

563
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,790
That was all there was to it, right?

564
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,900
There was more to it, actually?

565
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,220
I wanted to leave, you didn’t let me.

566
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,470
You pulled me to you.

567
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:42,920
Then you rested your face against mine, kissing me on the forehead.

568
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,230
You also said you…

569
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,190
Stop it.

570
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,360
I don’t believe you.

571
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,580
You made that up.

572
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,900
You think I made that up?

573
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,270
Yes.

574
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,370
I never do such things,

575
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,040
especially not with you.

576
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,960
Fine, I made that up.

577
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,620
I hope you’re relieved now.

578
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,620
I’m done talking to you.

579
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,410
Listen to me first. I don’t want us to be like this.

580
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,410
Neither do I!

581
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,560
But I don’t want your life to go downhill because of me.

582
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
Ever since you came into my life,

583
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,220
I’ve felt like I’m on cloud nine.

584
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,830
(Have you arrived? I want to talk to you.)

585
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,930
I’ve arrived for a while now.

586
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,820
But I don’t feel well. I couldn’t sleep last night.

587
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,950
(Really? Is it bad?)

588
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,800
I don’t know. I’m feeling a bit unsteady.

589
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
I want to get some rest.

590
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,600
(Okay, get a good rest.)

591
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,930
Sorry, Dy.

592
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,400
Bye.

593
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,520
Lemon tea, please.

594
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,930
How come he’s here?

595
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,510
Stop getting sidetracked already, Ten.

596
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,190
Chef.

597
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,730
Did I wake you?

598
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,330
That’s fine.

599
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,740
I’m sorry, Doc.

600
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,430
Don’t go yet.

601
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,790
Stay with me, please.

602
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,660
Is there anything you want to talk to me about?

603
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,100
We're going to be far from each other for real now.

604
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,960
During this semester break,

605
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,960
my father will send me to be an intern at the countryside hospital.

606
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,960
I'll be there for quite a while.

607
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,270
It's good to meet you here.

608
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,630
I have something to ask from you.

609
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,770
Can you prepare a meal box for me?

610
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:28,240
When I travel, I want your meal box to accompany me,

611
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,970
even though I wish it could be you accompanying me instead.

612
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,740
Sure.

613
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,340
Though I cannot be there with you,

614
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:53,120
I know I’m always in your heart.

615
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,970
Thank you, Chef.

616
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,590
Can I charge you?

617
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,990
Sure, tell me how much you want.

618
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,220
I don’t want to charge you with money.

619
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,650
I want you to recharge my energy.

620
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,960
Save that as a backup energy for when we’re not together.

621
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,440
TRAVELING DAY

622
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,520
I thought I couldn’t make it in time.

623
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,630
Why not? I will always wait for you.

624
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,960
Here, the meal box for you.

625
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,740
Don’t open it yet.

626
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,700
Open it while you travel.

627
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:47,360
Can’t I open it now?

628
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,740
No.

629
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,910
I’ve put a note with my feelings there.

630
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,260
Fine.

631
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,920
Alright then.

632
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,980
♪ I’m just someone ordinary ♪

633
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,990
♪ Nothing special about me ♪

634
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:16,300
♪ I’m following dreams on a journey ♪

635
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,390
♪ Not knowing what I’ll see ♪

636
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:24,520
♪ You lit up my darkest nights ♪

637
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,430
♪ Filled my heart with sugar delight ♪

638
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,970
You should go now.

639
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:33,970
I’m fine.

640
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,610
I want you to remember only the nice images of me.

641
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,110
Please wait for me.

642
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,070
Wear these.

643
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,350
Never take them off.

644
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,990
Why?

645
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,960
So that you can’t see anyone.

646
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,940
Even though they are in your sight, you can’t see them clearly.

647
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,230
Come on. I’m not going to do that.

648
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You wear them so that you can see me clearly.

649
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,870
Then please never look at anyone while I’m away.

650
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:39,990
And don’t give anyone a chance to flirt with you.

651
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,990
No, I’ll be the one flirting around.

652
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:42,790
What?

653
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,150
I was kidding.

654
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,720
Who would do that?

655
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,030
You’ve already operated on my heart.

656
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:56,620
I promise to be waiting for you.

657
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,470
Thank you.

658
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,300
Hello, Doc.

659
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,950
I also agree with your father’s words

660
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,550
that healthy relationships should not drag each other down.

661
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:37,750
Therefore, I’ll make him see the worth I have.

662
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,480
When I was little,

663
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,890
I remember that my grandma used to take me and my sister to Hua Hin by train.

664
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:01,270
She made sticky rice with shredded pork,

665
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,810
it’s a convenient meal for the journey.

666
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:07,420
This is the flavor that reminds me of her every time I travel.

667
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,240
So I want you to think of me every time too.

668
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,740
Though we are far apart from this moment on,

669
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,200
time will test our determination.

670
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,360
I’m your student now.

671
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,520
Take me back.

672
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:43,800
Your food not only fills my stomach but also warms my heart.

673
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,350
I’m truly happy to have your food.

674
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:04,210
You’re dedicated, I’m sure you’re becoming a great doctor.

675
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,460
Metha, my bestie. Come to Suphanburi with me.

676
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,970
Where’s Jane? She’s not with you?

677
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:23,210
Jane broke up with me. We’re history.

678
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:24,820
Ten is an intern in a hospital around here.

679
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,320
Tell him to do his best.

680
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,760
Where does it hurt, Chef?

681
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,000
It hurts here.

682
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,970
I tried so hard not to come see you. I’ve missed you.

683
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,620
Have you missed me?

684
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,310
You took my oven glove?

685
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:40,350
I want to put my hand in here with yours.

686
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,660
I want to know if it will tear the glove apart.
