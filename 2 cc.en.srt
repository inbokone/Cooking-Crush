All of them, please.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,740
Why don’t you leave some for others?

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,360
Hey, watch out!

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,200
Shit!

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,650
Tom Kha…

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,410
I'm not going to taste this dish.

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,820
Do I really have to throw this out?

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,230
I put my heart and soul into it.

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,060
Hey.

18
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,200
How did you even get in here?

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,090
I’m hungry.

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,060
Can you teach me how to cook?

21
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,300
I won’t teach you. You are a jinx. I don’t want to be near you.

22
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,450
This is my number.

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,750
Call me when you change your mind.

24
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,000
How is it? Delicious?

25
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,510
I happened to come across this taste.

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,020
I thought of you when I had it.

27
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,230
I must ask him to teach me cooking.

“FRIED PORK TOAST THAT MAKES YOU SMILE”

This must be permanent ink. You Doc!

40
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,500
Doc who?

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,440
What's with the staring?

42
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,940
You brought up Doc.

43
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,310
So you got yourself a new friend from med school?

44
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,310
I've seen him around here many times.

45
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,310
More of a jinx than a friend.

46
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,850
A med student? What's his major?

47
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,840
Probably astrology.

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,070
How's your horoscope treating you now?

49
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,860
I was kidding, come on.

50
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,860
Just keeping up with the flow.

51
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,270
Why does he come to you so often? What does this guy want?

52
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,490
He pesters me to teach him how to cook.

53
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,500
But I don't want to do it.

54
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,470
As if med school isn't tough already.

55
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,640
Why's he so keen on learning to cook?

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,060
Yeah, it doesn’t sound right.

57
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,780
Are you lying to us?

58
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,300
I've told you the whole truth. Don't worry about him.

59
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,640
I already said no.

60
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,100
He won't bug me anymore.

61
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,510
What's your take on this?

62
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,860
I'm not buying it.

63
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,860
Um. Same here.

64
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,410
Can you see him?

65
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,050
Is he around?

66
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,550
Nowhere in sight.

67
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,550
You're stressing over nothing, Prem.

68
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,300
I don’t spot him either.

69
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,950
Oh, there!

70
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,680
You cat face! How dare you prank me?

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,330
You disrespect me. Do you even know who I am?

72
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,540
Firefy!

73
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,210
- Firefy, my foot!
- Easy!

74
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,660
My name is Fire, Akkee Ploengpirotechoechuanchatchawan

75
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,790
I'm so tough, ruthless, and cruel.

76
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,900
How dare you…

77
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,930
Hey, be cool to my friend.

78
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,720
Be cool?

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,020
Do you have any clue what your friend did to me?

80
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,930
He gave me a girl’s contact, so I made a call yesterday.

81
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,260
It turned out to be his own contact.

82
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,820
Do you think that's okay?

83
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,330
I'm not okay with it.

84
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,920
What?

85
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,240
Is he some sort of ninja?

86
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,450
Catch me if you can.

87
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,060
Stay right there.

88
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,300
I'll put down 5 baht.

89
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,530
Mine's 20.

90
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,730
Dy's gonna get a punch.

91
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,730
Where do you think you're going?!

92
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,190
You're in trouble now.

93
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,780
Oops, dead end. Can't dodge you anymore.

94
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,550
Time to unleash your ruthlessness on me.

95
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,550
What the heck are you saying?

96
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,710
What in heaven’s name did you give me your own number for?

97
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,370
Not in heaven's name, but in my name, so I could talk to you.

98
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,820
I don't want to talk to you.

99
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,030
I'm not into this kind of prank.

100
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,090
I apologize. I was only trying to have some fun by teasing you.

101
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,310
But I don't appreciate being teased.

102
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,120
Stay the hell away from me.

103
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,500
That's harsh.

104
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,650
Love it!

105
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,680
There are 24 hours in a day.

106
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,070
Your medical studies take up 16 hours,

107
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,390
and you have less than 4 hours for sleep.

108
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,060
And now you want to learn cooking?

109
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,490
This could seriously kill you, man.

110
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,200
Don’t you ever want to cook for someone you love?

111
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,300
There you go again.

112
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,440
I'm trying to stress it's a matter of life and death,

113
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,380
and you're getting all sentimental.

114
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,880
If he won't teach you after so many attempts,

115
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
find someone else who's up for it.

116
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,200
There are plenty of students from that culinary class there.

117
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,300
I don’t want just anyone to teach me.

118
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,680
I want to be taught by him only.

119
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,540
Damn you, jackass.

120
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,090
They're from the same class, learning the same stuff.

121
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,620
It doesn’t make any difference who teaches you.

122
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,360
Not the same.

123
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,520
How come?

124
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,310
Have you ever been to a restaurant and loved their food very much?

125
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,570
But when you returned, it tasted different?

126
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,230
Why?

127
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,730
It's because the chef changed.

128
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,960
Even with the same recipe, it can turn out different.

129
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,210
That's the art of cooking. Get it?

130
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,550
The art of cooking.

131
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,460
I just like his cooking.

132
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,230
So, is it his cooking or him that you're into?

133
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,250
Your explanation is longer than I expected.

134
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,400
Seems like you're trying too hard.

135
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,300
I genuinely want to learn.

136
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,880
His cooking tastes just like…

137
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,450
her favorite flavor.

138
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,720
That's something you can never let go.

139
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,010
It's not that I can't let go.

140
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,240
I've just found what I've been searching for.

141
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,180
Got it? I've found it.

142
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,360
I've found it!

143
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,640
I got it. But why try to find someone who imitates that taste?

144
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,960
Why not search for the original recipe?

145
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,830
You're right.

146
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,940
Damn

147
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,560
You

148
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,450
Bastard!

149
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,700
Ouch.

150
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,980
Are you hurt?

151
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,770
Yes.

152
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,280
It hurts pretty bad.

153
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,650
Aren’t you gonna give me some comfort?

154
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,790
Don’t ask for attention.

155
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,080
I might just give you another hit.

156
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,340
I told you to leave me alone.

157
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,000
Fine.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,170
I even got Jane’s actual contact here.

159
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,310
Really?

160
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,620
Is it for real this time? Or are you pulling another prank on me? Show me.

161
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,140
It’s real.

162
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,830
You wait here.

163
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,450
It’s really her.

[Add Friend]

165
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,210
Woah. Look at your happy ears.

166
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,350
I even successfully completed this mission for you.

167
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,810
My head hurts.

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,330
Not sure if it cracks.

169
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,980
Did you get a crack?

170
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,020
No.

171
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,020
Then don’t cry.

172
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,770
Fine. Hang on a sec.

173
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,970
How should I hit it to my head to get a crack?

174
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,580
Ouch.

175
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,040
Ouch, it hurts.

176
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,060
Ouch.

177
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,800
Oi, I’m bleeding.

178
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,560
Ouch.

179
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,530
You moron.

180
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,600
Let me.

181
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
I’ll teach you.

182
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,680
You hold it like this.

183
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,520
Ouch.

184
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,140
How’s that? That's how it can crack your head.

185
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,060
See you at 11, Jane, my dear.

186
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,670
Pay attention to where you're walking.

187
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,470
Stop looking at your phone for a sec or you might trip down the stairs.

188
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,650
Sorry, Mother.

189
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,540
It's not a school day. Where are you headed?

190
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,790
I have a tutoring session.

191
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,770
Where?

192
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,810
At Ten's place.

193
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,530
What subject?

194
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,590
Math.

195
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,510
When will you be back?

196
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,390
Before 10 p.m., Mother.

197
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,540
I'll give you a ride. Let's go.

198
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,470
Come on, hurry up.

199
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,870
Yes, Mother.

200
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,260
Hey, Prem.

201
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,680
I just realized I forgot to ask the number of people

202
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,710
from the customer who called for a table reservation.

203
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,430
Could you call back and ask for me?

204
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,060
I wrote down his number in the notebook."

205
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,990
Sure.

206
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,520
0

207
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,540
8

208
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,140
6

209
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,050
7

210
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,140
9

211
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,370
1

212
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,120
5

213
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,820
6

214
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,300
Hello.

215
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
I’m right in front of the restaurant now.

216
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,660
Did you follow me here?

217
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,080
No, I didn’t.

218
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,660
I just made a reservation here.

219
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,330
I didn’t know this was your restaurant.

220
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,230
You sure? This is a bit much, Doc.

221
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,680
You came all the way to my place.

222
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,260
I really made a reservation here.

223
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,260
I’ve accepted that you didn’t want to teach me.

224
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,830
Don’t worry.

225
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,070
Just a table for one, ma’am.

226
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,720
You look familiar.

227
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
I used to dine here when I was little.

228
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,600
Do you remember me?

229
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,020
Ahhh.

230
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,920
No.

231
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,540
Oh.

232
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,190
That’s quite a long ‘Ah’.

233
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,990
This place was famous and used to be bustling with customers.

234
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,360
I can't recall everyone.

235
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,240
You can have a break.

236
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,440
I’ll take care of this customer.

237
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,730
Okay.

238
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,450
I’m going to my table then.

239
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,360
If my verbal rejection doesn’t make him back off easily,

240
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,550
I might need to take stronger measures to deal with him.

241
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,470
Good morning, ma’am. Can I help carry anything from your car?

242
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,160
No, I just dropped Fire off to see Ten.

243
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,510
But Mr. Ten has left.

244
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,310
Don’t you have a tutoring session with Ten?

245
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,610
Did you lie to me?

246
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,250
No, I didn’t, Mother.

247
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,720
I don’t believe you.

248
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,660
I can tell.

249
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,120
When you lie, your eyes roll to the right.

250
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,590
So who were you on the phone with last night?

251
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,400
Are you really here for tutoring, or do you have other plans?

252
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,860
Explain. Don’t stay silent. You know I don’t like it.

253
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,510
Hi there, Fire.

254
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,200
Hello, my friend.

255
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,050
Oh, your mother is here too.

256
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,980
Good morning, ma’am. What brings you here?

257
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,450
I’m here to drop off Fire.

258
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,520
He's supposed to have tutoring with Ten.

259
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,960
But Ten isn't home. Are you hiding something from me?

260
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,100
No, ma’am.

261
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Ten just went out to buy snacks.

262
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,260
We plan to have an extended tutoring session, so we could all stay inside.

263
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,980
I'll join them too.

264
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,620
All three of us, ma’am.

265
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,350
I think I'll wait until Ten returns.

266
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,060
I want to personally thank him for tutoring my son.

267
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,660
I don’t think that’s a good idea, ma’am.

268
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,310
The sun is very strong. It could damage your skin.

269
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,730
The sun is indeed strong. I’m concerned about you, Mother.

270
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,980
You’re right. Then I'll leave my son in your care, Metha.

271
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,620
My pleasure, ma’am.

272
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,250
Be careful on the road, Mother.

273
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,250
Goodbye, ma’am.

274
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,350
Bye-bye.

275
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,040
Drive safely.

276
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,550
I’ll study hard, Mother.

277
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,910
Gosh.

278
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,910
That was close.

279
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,610
Good thing you live next door.

280
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,230
I was almost in deep shit.

281
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,780
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

282
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,400
Next time, text me first.

283
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
You were almost busted, you see?

284
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
My heart almost stopped.

285
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Look, Metha.

286
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,280
What?

287
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,370
I’m heading out first.

288
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,370
Where to?

289
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,280
Got a date with a girl.

290
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,010
A girl, seriously?

291
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,840
You're in such high spirits after that close call.

292
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,050
Take care of these for me.

293
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,600
Sure thing, buddy.

294
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,940
I’m happy when my friend is happy.

295
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,770
You bounce back to happiness pretty quickly.

296
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,120
Fire!

297
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,690
That’s my scooter!

298
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,260
Fire!

299
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,270
Is everything alright there?

300
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,980
Yes. This thing just dropped.

301
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,370
Sorry for being late.

302
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,540
I have coffee for you.

303
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,330
What would you like,

304
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,860
Americano or Latte?

305
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,090
Latte, please.

306
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,960
Thank you.

307
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,300
You must have been sitting here for a while. Want to take a walk?

308
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,140
Sure.

309
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,440
Shit!

310
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,710
How on earth is he here?

311
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,770
What’s the matter?

312
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,770
Well, I just saw…

313
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,870
Eh?

314
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,930
I must have mistaken something.

315
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,320
Shall we go?

316
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,100
Let’s go.

317
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,350
I look funny. I’m too close to the camera.

318
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:06,890
Which one?

319
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,000
No, you look very cute there.

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,220
One, two, three.

321
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,180
Is everything alright?

322
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,180
Are you looking for someone?

323
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,860
No one.

324
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,420
Shit!

325
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,440
Are you following me?

326
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,140
Jane, pedal at full speed!

327
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
Excuse me, sir.

328
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,270
Please enjoy your meal.

329
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,770
May I, sir.

330
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,610
Sorry, I’m a bit too excited.

331
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,720
Sorry.

332
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,750
All set, sir.

333
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,150
What the…

334
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,500
You scoundrel.

335
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,890
Is it meant for eating?

336
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,940
It is.

337
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,940
Don’t you come all the way for this?

338
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,420
Dig in.

339
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,260
Knock yourself out.

340
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,660
Go ahead.

341
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,980
I said, eat it!

342
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,440
I’ll eat it now.

343
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,730
Yuck!

344
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,110
Doc, you alright?

345
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,160
Is this food meant for humans?

346
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,470
It smells like rust, almost like licking an iron sheet.

347
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,060
Really? Jeez.

348
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,000
If you don’t believe me, try it yourself.

349
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,520
It’s fine.

350
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,760
I told you that this is the best I can cook.

351
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,470
I’m lame.

352
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,720
You didn’t believe me so here’s the proof.

353
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,120
Stop convincing me to be your cooking teacher.

354
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,670
Look, there are no customers here at all.

355
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,740
My restaurant could go out of business anytime soon.

356
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,320
No customers at all.

357
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,080
Please drop your idea of having me teach you, Doc.

358
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,430
Are you stalking me?

359
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,710
What are you talking about?

360
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,450
I’m just here with my friend.

361
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,450
Cut the act.

362
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,520
I keep seeing you everywhere. Why are you following me?

363
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,190
Come on.

364
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,190
The fact that you keep seeing me

365
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,290
is probably because you always look for me.

366
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,960
I’m definitely not looking for you.

367
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,210
You’re the one following me.

368
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,150
Okay.

369
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,270
If it bothers you, I’ll go hang out somewhere else with my friend.

370
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,870
Good.

371
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,870
But I want you to think about what I said again.

372
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,460
Maybe you've got eyes only for me.

373
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,100
Shut your mouth and just go the hell away.

374
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,000
Don’t forget to keep me in mind.

375
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,870
Today was fun.

376
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,160
It’s been ages since I pedaled a duck boat.

377
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,280
Um.

378
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Are you okay, Fire?

379
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,480
I’m okay.

380
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,930
Me too, I haven’t pedaled a duck boat in ages.

381
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,230
My legs are killing me now.

382
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,780
My ride's here. I’m heading off first.

383
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,300
Okay.

384
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,290
Call me when you get home.

385
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,820
Sure. Goodbye.

386
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,730
[How was it? Did you have fun dating without me in your sight?]

387
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,510
Fun, my ass. You were crashing my date.

388
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,570
This is not good. This might make him happy thinking I care.

389
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,330
Get this.

390
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:44,760
It was indeed A LOT OF fun. Jane was REALLY wonderful.

391
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,930
How’s about this?

392
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,110
It was indeed A LOT OF fun. Jane was REALLY wonderful.

393
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,340
The hell? Why did he have to stress it like that?

394
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,770
This is annoying.

395
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,420
Do you think Firefy was genuinely having a great time?

396
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,450
What the hell is wrong with you?

397
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,870
Just accept it.

398
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,010
There’s nothing you can do.

399
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,600
He’s avoiding you like you are some kind of shit.

400
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,910
That’s hurtful.

401
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,610
You are my friend, Unky.

402
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,240
You brought this upon yourself.

403
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,620
Ouch, Dy. Oi!

404
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,500
Has your friend gone?

405
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,380
He’s gone forever, Grandma.

406
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,850
What did you say?

407
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,940
Nothing. Forget about him.

408
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,880
Pang!

409
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,280
Why didn’t you greet Grandma?

410
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,440
Grandma, good evening.

411
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,090
What’s wrong with her?

412
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,280
Don’t mind her. She just got back from cram school.

413
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,600
Probably too tired.

414
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,560
But she’s been like this for a few days.

415
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,460
Really?

416
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,560
Um.

417
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,900
What’s wrong, Pang?

418
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
Why didn’t you stop and show respect to Grandma?

419
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,020
She worked her back off all day long.

420
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,820
She doesn't deserve to be treated like this.

421
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,470
Huh?

422
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,470
I asked what’s wrong.

423
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,590
Are you stressing over your studies?

424
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,130
Prem.

425
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:32,640
What’s the matter, buttface?

426
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,400
What?

427
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,200
You lost 50,000 baht?

428
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,710
I left my wallet in the cram school’s toilet.

429
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,510
When I remembered and went back for it,

430
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,120
all the money was gone.

431
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,480
All that’s left is just an empty wallet.

432
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,410
I need your help.

433
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,880
Please.

434
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,230
Don’t cry. Pull yourself together.

435
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,010
But where can I get 50,000 baht from?

436
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:07,340
Please help me. I don’t know what to do.

437
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,770
You have to help me.

438
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:27,430
This phone should be worth around 15,000,

439
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,150
but the screen shattered like a spider web.

440
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,580
I might only get 10,000 for it.

441
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,630
This notebook,

442
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,330
I should only get around 4,000 from the pawn shop.

443
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,310
The watch might fetch 700.

444
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,470
In total,

445
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:03,950
I should get about 15,000 baht.

446
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,330
Where can I get the remaining 35,000?

447
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,390
Oi!

448
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,810
This is my number.

449
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,580
Call me when you change your mind.

450
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,350
8

451
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,990
67

452
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,510
Who’s calling at this hour?

453
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,250
Hello

454
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,390
Have you gone to bed yet, Doc?

455
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,720
What? Who am I speaking with?

456
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,000
It’s me, the adorable little chef.

457
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,410
Ah, Chef.

458
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,410
What’s the matter?

459
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,170
So what is it?

460
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,220
You didn’t tell me last night

461
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,920
the important matter you wanted to talk about.

462
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,200
Please accept my apology.

463
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,450
I want to apologize to you for everything I’ve done.

464
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,490
What’s going on?

465
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,780
You seem like a totally different person.

466
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,180
I’m being righteous.

467
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,410
People often reflect on the good and bad things they do.

468
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,110
I've thought about your request.

469
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,880
You must genuinely want to learn cooking.

470
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,330
Otherwise, you wouldn’t go all out like that.

471
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,870
And now, I’m ready to teach you.

472
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,720
Really?

473
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,000
Yes.

474
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,580
But I don’t want to learn now.

475
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,910
Huh?

476
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,200
Why not?

477
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,780
Your cooking isn’t consistent.

478
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,610
That day, your Tom Kha Gai was seriously tasty.

479
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,900
But when I visited your restaurant,

480
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,970
it was not that at all.

481
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,500
It was like really not that!

482
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,220
I purposely played a trick on you that day.

483
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,220
I did it to make you stop bothering me.

484
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,040
My grandmother scolded me after she found out.

485
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,250
Her scolding made me realize

486
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,840
I'd like to make up for it

487
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,020
if you're still interested in learning cooking from me.

488
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,250
Please.

489
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,710
Please, Doc.

490
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,780
Please.

491
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,580
Please.

492
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,250
Here.

493
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,860
It’s less sweetened but it’s surely tasty.

494
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,280
Are you giving this to me so I won't eat much?

495
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,450
No, I just want you to have something while waiting.

496
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,670
Take it.

497
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,270
Please wait a bit.

498
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,720
I'll put my best effort into my cooking.

499
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,120
Could you please give my food another chance?

500
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,040
Then you can decide if you still want me to teach you.

501
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,450
Alright,

502
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,310
can I choose what dish to make?

503
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,570
I want to have…

504
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,740
Fried Pork Toast.

505
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,180
Look here son. Let me take a picture.

506
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,090
No!

507
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,480
Why not? Come on.

508
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,640
I don’t want to eat this.

509
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,910
Come on. It’s your mother’s birthday, remember?

510
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,800
You put too little pork topping there.

511
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,880
Yes, one slice of chili.

512
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,810
What comes next?

513
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,340
And the green veggie.

514
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,510
You really got these skills from the best.

515
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,350
Here you go.

516
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,850
It’s ready.

517
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,410
I’m gonna eat it now.

518
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,450
It’s delicious.

519
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,190
Just as delicious as before.

520
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,000
I told you, right?

521
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,600
So you agree to learn cooking with me, right?

522
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,820
Okay.

523
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,150
I'll charge you 50,000 baht for my cooking course.

524
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,490
Too expensive?

525
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,520
Deal. 50,000 it is.

526
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,960
I’m your student now.

527
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,520
Welcome on board.

528
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
I want to show you this route in the back.

529
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,900
After this bridge, you can get to the parking lot faster.

530
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,140
Hey, Chef.

531
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,790
Save my phone number and add me on the chat app.

532
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,540
I’ve been waiting to chat with you since yesterday.

533
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,680
Ah, sure. I’ll add you shortly.

534
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,010
I refused to teach you not because I called you a jinx.

535
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,360
It’s because I lack the capability.

536
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,360
I’m the least skilled in my class.

537
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,810
I can’t teach anyone.

538
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,800
If there’s one thing I’m good at, it's the dishwashing task.

539
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,440
I actually knew

540
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,740
that you intentionally made the food taste bad for me.

541
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,730
You're a good cook with culinary skills.

542
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,870
I've tasted your food before, and I can vouch for that.

543
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,580
You can teach. Trust me.

544
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,720
Don't doubt yourself.

545
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,320
Woah. You're praising me too much, Doc.

546
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
I meant every word.

547
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,080
I appreciate that.

548
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,630
Take care. See you.

549
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,680
Thank you, Doc.

550
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,890
For this 50,000 baht,

551
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,710
I'll give my all in teaching you.

552
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,110
Thank you.

553
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,250
[It’s me, Doc.]

554
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,320
[Yes, Chef.]

555
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,700
[You can save this as “Prem”.]

556
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:39,050
[My name is Ten. But you can save it with any name you like.]

557
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:44,810
[Alright.]

558
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:57,150
[I’ll call you Doc like before then.]

559
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:04,530
[Sure thing. I’m used to calling you Chef too.]

560
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,930
[When would you like to start learning? And at what time?]

561
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:21,220
[This Saturday at 10 AM, my place. What do you say?]

562
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
At his place?

563
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,420
Will he be okay with me inviting him over?

564
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,800
[We can learn anywhere else.]

565
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,450
[I don’t mind at all. Your place is fine.]

566
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:45,170
[What’s the first dish you want to learn?]

567
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,570
[Tom Kha Gai, please.]

568
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,250
[Okay.]

569
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,250
Can’t get enough of it, heh?

570
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,190
Prem, what is this?

571
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,900
How did you get 50,000 baht?

572
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,370
Did you do anything illegally?

573
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,720
Shh. Keep it down.

574
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,460
Did you sell drugs?

575
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,670
Are you nuts? I would never.

576
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,460
I managed to find a way out for you.

577
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,410
Don’t worry about it too much.

578
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,540
Thank you, Brother.

579
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,760
Be more careful next time, you clumsy girl.

580
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,400
I’ll go and withdraw this right now.

581
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,920
I’ll be super careful this time not to leave it behind.

582
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,060
But it’s too late tonight.

583
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,640
Seriously, Pang!

584
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,940
[Not dog food, but Doc’s food]

585
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,370
Shit.

586
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,900
What do I do now?

587
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,890
[I wish you could see Fire’s face when he saw us.]

588
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,140
[Wherever Fire was, Dy dragged me along with him to bug Fire.]

589
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,540
[Are you stalking him?]

590
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,000
[Not stalking. I just positioned myself there for him to see. No secret hiding.]

591
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,060
[And the expression Dy told me to make was hilarious.]

592
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,370
[What expression was it?]

593
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:57,340
[todsatid10 liked your photo.]

594
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,090
Is he snooping on me?

595
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,500
[prempremmatat followed you.]

596
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,700
[How did you find my IG?]

597
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,800
[Oh, it just popped up in 'Suggestion'.]

598
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,600
[I see. Are you still awake?]

599
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,620
[You called me last night without asking that.]

600
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:37,310
[I usually stay up late. How about you? Still awake?]

601
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,730
[I’m about to go to bed soon.]

602
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:50,330
[OK. I won’t bother you then.]

603
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,640
And this is the face of the winner, our 219-time champion–

604
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,580
Chef Chang Ma, the unconquerable Super Monster Chef.

605
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,780
219 times? That's insane.

606
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,750
Tell me about it!

607
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,750
He's been the champ since I started at the Accounting Faculty.

608
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,540
And now I'm in my third year here. Crazy, huh?

609
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,820
That was like a century ago, Unky.

610
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,680
A century, my foot?

611
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,780
I spent 3 years in engineering, 3 in accounting, and now 3 in culinary.

612
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,130
Just 9 years in total, not a century!

613
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,150
9 freaking years. You could've gotten a doctorate degree.

614
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,230
I just enjoy learning. What's your issue?

615
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,110
Unlike you, who skipped Grade 12.

616
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,270
Are you mocking me?

618
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,080
Do you think I'm scared of you?

619
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,650
I'm not scared of you either.

620
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,560
You two have fun fighting.

621
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,640
I'm heading home first.

622
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,850
Need to prep for my cooking lessons.

623
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,850
Cooking lessons what?

624
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,450
Remember that med student who wants me to teach cooking.

625
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,010
I've already agreed to teach him.

626
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,400
I thought you completely turned him down.

627
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,440
I asked for 50,000 baht, and he didn’t seem to mind,

628
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,030
so I don’t mind teaching him.

629
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,160
You asked for 50,000 baht, and he agreed right away.

630
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,720
There could be two reasons...

631
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,670
Which are...?

632
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,020
Either he likes you or he likes you a lot.

633
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,570
That’s the same thing.

634
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,080
Besides, his family is rich; money is not a problem.

635
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,400
He mentioned that.

636
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,760
Then why didn’t you ask for more money?

637
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,990
Nah,

638
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,560
I feel bad already with that amount.

639
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,230
I just need enough to cover Pang’s tuition fee.

640
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,730
He likes you.

641
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,230
What’s wrong with you?

642
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,560
Where did I leave my phone?

643
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,540
Dr. Ten?

644
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,970
What is this?

645
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,550
Give it.

646
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,070
Oh my, oh my. You saved his name ‘Dr. Ten.’

647
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:03,800
Look.

648
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,440
Dr. Ten.

649
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,130
- Dr. Ten.
- 	Give it.

650
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,550
Dr. Ten.

651
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,890
Hello.

652
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,000
He hung up.

653
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,710
Sorry.

654
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,640
From the way I see…

655
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,540
Not just him being into you.

656
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,700
I think you like him too.

657
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,980
Call him back. Now.

658
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,980
It’s too late to call him at this time.

659
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:25,710
You like him.

660
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,350
It’s not that late. He just hung up not 10 sec ago.

661
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,560
He could've accidentally hit the call button.

662
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,780
You like him!

663
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,590
Come on. Call him back. Hurry.

664
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,590
Ask him to go grocery shopping with you.

665
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,750
What did he say?

666
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,700
[Chef, have you gone grocery shopping?]

667
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,230
He’s inviting you for grocery shopping. Call him. Say yes now.

668
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,970
- You like him. He likes you.
- Let’s go to the market together, Doc.

669
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,300
- You like him and he likes you.
- Let’s go to the market together.

670
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,580
Call him. Call him now.

671
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,030
Stop it!

672
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,230
- You like him and he likes you.
- Call him now. Call him.

673
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,210
[I'm going tomorrow. I’d rather get fresh ingredients.]

674
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,630
[Where are you going?]

675
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,180
[How about I ask my maid to get them ready for you?]

676
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:08,350
[It’s okay. I want to buy them myself. There's a fresh market nearby.]

677
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:11,410
[Do you want to do that?]

678
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,680
[Yes.]

679
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,630
[What time will you be there?]

680
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,210
[Around 7 a.m., I think.]

681
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:24,020
[I'll come with you then.]

682
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,180
[Okay.]

683
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:35,110
[Alright, I'll stop bothering you now. See you tomorrow.]
[Good night.]

684
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,400
[Alright, I'll stop bothering you now. See you tomorrow.]
[Good night.]

685
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,460
[See you tomorrow...then.]

686
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,020
I’m heading out first.

687
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,610
Take care. Bye-bye.

688
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,300
Bye-bye.

689
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,540
You guys aren’t going to...?

690
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,440
Nah, only if and when you feel like sharing.

691
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,820
You never keep secrets from us.

692
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,260
Alright, take care, pal.

693
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,030
Bye.

694
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,060
Um...

695
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,240
What should we do next, Unky?

696
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,650
Aren’t you heading back too?

697
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,170
I don’t need to rush home tonight.

698
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,110
How about watching a horror movie?

699
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,890
No way! I get scared easily.

700
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,480
How about I tell you a ghost story?

701
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,010
Damn it. I told you I’m scared.

702
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,220
Listen to this one -

703
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,970
the story of the fried-egg building in our faculty...

704
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,160
You jerk, Dy!

705
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:17,790
Fresh market, fresh market.

706
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,720
What style should I go for?

707
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,210
This seems too thick for the weather.

708
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,330
Hmm, fresh market, fresh market...

709
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,360
Fresh market, right?

710
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,270
This is too stylish.

711
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,440
Fresh market.

712
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,120
Why am I overthinking?

713
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,800
Just go for casual clothes.

714
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,190
[I’m already here, Doc.]

715
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:53,300
[I don’t mean to rush you, just letting you know.]

716
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,950
[I’m also here.]

717
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,590
Morning, Chef.

718
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:11,970
Morning, Doc.

719
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,530
Am I dressed inappropriately for this?

720
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,870
No, not at all. Your outfit is right on point.

721
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,000
Very nice.

722
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,190
And white shoes too?

723
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,020
Aren’t you afraid they'll get dirty?

724
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,530
They're meant to be used. It’s fine.

725
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:35,690
I see. If you say so.

726
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,090
Let’s go.

727
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,940
This way, Doc.

728
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,330
Make way, please.

729
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,710
Oi.

730
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,200
Doc, I have tissue paper.

731
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,170
Are you okay?

732
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
I’m fine. Don’t worry.

733
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,030
Which stall are you buying from? Lead the way.

734
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,340
Alright.

735
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,920
What are you looking for today, Prem?

736
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,680
(Who is he?)

737
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,230
None. You have none of it.

738
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,860
What are you looking for?

739
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:51,720
Your manners.

740
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,820
That hurts.

741
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,730
Your words are sharp this early in the morning.

742
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,730
Alright, what would you like to buy?

743
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,730
I’m buying young galangal for Tom Kha soup.

744
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:04,700
How young? Like that man’s face young?

745
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,560
My face is not just young but also good looking.

746
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,460
How envious. Your words are sharp too.

747
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,740
Auntie, look at them talking.

748
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,430
Jaa!

749
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,870
Enough already!

750
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,530
What's the relationship between you two?

751
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,190
I’m his college friend.

752
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:27,020
College friend or call-me-baby friend?

753
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:27,780
We can find it somewhere else.

754
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,360
Just kidding! Here you go.

755
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,010
Don’t mind my nosy behavior.

756
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:35,100
Here's some super young galangal for you.

757
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,920
Doc, watch it!

758
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,340
I'll wait at the entrance then.

759
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,260
Chef, do you usually come here for ingredients?

760
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,830
Yes, it’s close to my place, and things are reasonably priced.

761
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:25,810
You don’t have to shop here to save cost for me.

762
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,000
We can go to a supermarket.

763
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,570
It's fine. We can find fresh ingredients here

764
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,700
and select exactly what we want for our cooking.

765
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,820
Okay, then please follow me to my place.

766
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,940
Um.

767
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,470
Here we go.

768
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:49,440
Before cooking, what should we start with?

769
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,840
Learning knife skills?

770
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,960
Nope, wrong.

771
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,440
We must start with being happy.

772
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,870
If we cook with happiness,

773
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,610
the food we make can give the person who eats it a taste of happiness too.

774
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,110
Wow, Chef.

775
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,930
Are you adding philosophy to your cooking lessons?

776
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:09,300
It’s what I believe, so I want to share it with you.

777
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,020
But you don’t need to take it seriously.

778
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,850
Let's get started.

779
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,080
What is this called?

780
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:15,700
Ginger?

781
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,060
Incorrect. This isn't ginger. We just bought this at the market.

782
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,060
Ginger isn't used in Tom Kha soup.

783
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,600
This is galangal, not ginger.

784
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,380
Got it.

785
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,800
Okay.

786
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,030
Let’s start slicing it.

787
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:39,300
My grandma taught me

788
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,300
to get the best taste of Tom Kha,

789
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,390
you need to use young galangal.

790
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,850
Cut it into round shapes like this.

791
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:51,570
Okay.

792
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,690
Then cut other veggies and put them on the side.

793
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:57,430
Since you have only one chopping board,

794
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,830
let's finish chopping veggies first.

795
00:50:58,830 --> 00:50:59,510
Then we cut the meat.

796
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,510
Otherwise, it might absorb the meat smell.

797
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:09,240
I’ll let you slice the chicken into the shape you prefer.

798
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,210
Alright.

799
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,170
Hey, Doc.

800
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,600
Are you performing surgery on the chicken meat?

801
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,330
Here's how you slice chicken.

802
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:32,700
Doc, sorry.

803
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,270
I didn’t mean to do that.

804
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,400
Did I do anything that upset you?

805
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,600
No, you didn’t.

806
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,870
But I noticed this change in you since we were at the market.

807
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:42,860
I didn't mean any harm.

808
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,900
That guy didn’t seem to avoid you.

809
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,990
If he had bumped into you,

810
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,160
your clothes might have gotten wet.

811
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,660
I understand.

812
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:52,420
I'm just not used to physical contact.

813
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,130
All my close friends are aware of this,

814
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:58,080
so I react this way.

815
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,720
I unintentionally touched you several times?

816
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,450
I didn’t realize that.

817
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,870
Don’t worry about it.

818
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:09,780
What should I do?

819
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,780
You don’t have to do anything.

820
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,780
Just be yourself and act as you usually do.

821
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,450
Don’t worry about it.

822
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:19,240
I'm the one trying to adjust.

823
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,450
Are you really okay?

824
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:21,990
Okay.

825
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,600
I'll be okay.

826
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,610
Finished. Try it.

827
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,950
Okay. Spoon.

828
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,630
No, I’ll get it for you.

829
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,630
Hold on.

830
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,080
Thank you.

831
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,640
It’s very delicious.

832
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,890
It’s exactly this taste.

833
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,410
See? I told you that you could do it too.

834
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:10,250
Thank you so much.

835
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:14,320
Don’t thank me. You did all of this yourself.

836
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,770
Here you go, Mr. Ten.

837
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,510
Thank you, Mai.

838
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:20,280
I’ll take it from here.

839
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,510
Alright.

840
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,410
I thought you wanted to cook this for yourself.

841
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:30,340
I have someone whom I want to try this.

842
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,720
I see.

843
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,800
I got to learn cooking now.

844
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,000
Did you forget something here?

845
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,850
No. I just have something I want you to try.

846
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:31,190
Just in case you like any dish and want to learn how to make it.

847
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,000
200,000!

848
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,650
Your friend is learning to cook with my friend.

849
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,350
The course is seriously overpriced.

850
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,350
Are you trying to be around him as much as you can?

851
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:39,970
I think you’ve fallen for him.

852
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,970
Can you teach me how to make steamed egg?

853
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:45,270
​The steamed egg I’m teaching you today is Thai style steamed egg.

854
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,340
Not a custard-like Japanese steamed egg.
