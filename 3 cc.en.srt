Is this food meant for humans?

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,020
It smells like rust, almost like licking an iron sheet.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,390
Please drop your idea of having me teach you, Doc.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:24,710
What?

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,560
You lost 50,000 baht?

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,490
Please help me.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,330
It’s delicious.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,490
So you agree to learn cooking with me, right?

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,990
I'll charge you 50,000 baht for my cooking course.

13
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,980
Deal.

14
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,690
I’m your student now.

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,210
We must start with being happy.

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,720
The food we make can give the person who eats it a taste of happiness too.

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,720
It’s very delicious.

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,730
What’s up, Dy?

30
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,250
Spill it all.

31
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,870
Got any butterfly moments for me to ship?

32
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,090
Ship, my ass.

33
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,700
Your radar must be broken.

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,980
He’s taken.

35
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,010
What? Did he tell you that he’s seeing someone?

36
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,670
After we finished cooking today,

37
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,150
I thought he would dig in right away.

38
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,980
Turns out, he saved it for his girlfriend.

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,720
How do you know he cooked it for his girlfriend?

40
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,900
I saw his girlfriend's picture on his post.

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,730
Seriously?

42
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,260
I’ll grab a screencap and send it to you. Hold on.

43
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,110
Got it?

44
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,470
Seriously?

45
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,580
Enough with the “seriously” already.

46
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,850
Now you know he isn’t really into me.

47
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,060
Don't whip it up.

48
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,390
Alright. But at least you got 50,000 baht for teaching him that dish.

49
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,030
That’s the best deal ever.

50
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,880
Hey, Dy. I’ve got to go now. I’m busy.

51
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,770
Always saying busy whenever he doesn’t want to answer.

52
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,410
What’s this gross smell from?

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,140
Not this.

54
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,530
Ah, this jerk.

55
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,920
You selfishly leave this here again.

56
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,050
One day, I’ll put holes in your garbage bags.

57
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,110
So, that’s how you got the money.

58
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,410
Is he asking for more lessons from you?

59
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,830
Nah. I think that was our last session.

60
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,750
What? Why?

61
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,640
I've already collected enough for your tuition fee.

62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,820
But he paid you 50,000 baht. You should continue.

63
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,300
Nah.

64
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,010
It wouldn't be right to continue overcharging him like that.

65
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,550
You could make a lot in a single day's work.

66
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,450
You told me you wanted to renovate this place into a chef's table.

67
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,140
You have the chance to do it now. Why don’t you seize it?

68
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,700
Give it some thought.

69
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,970
Hey, don’t stop. Keep peeling the eggs.

70
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,390
Have you washed your hands?

71
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,190
I have, hon.

72
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,840
Why don’t you put serving spoons on all dishes?

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,310
Do I have to remind you every time?

74
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,580
I’ll get them now.

75
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,760
Mother,

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,600
I have something to show you.

77
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,850
What is it, dear?

78
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,950
Look.

79
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,780
Wow, another 4.00 GPA!

80
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,400
Well done.

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,950
You're truly amazing, my son. Let me give you a sniff kiss.

82
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,950
Sure.

83
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,730
What’s wrong? Can't I give you a sniff kiss anymore?

84
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,730
No, Mother.

85
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,980
Keep up with your good grades, okay?

86
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,530
Don't let them drop.

87
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,700
Yes, Mother.

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,840
Mother...

89
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,360
I've been studying very hard lately.

90
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,000
There are so many subjects to cover.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,270
I need to delve into numerous books and stay up late for papers.

92
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,730
When I get home every day, it feels like my body is falling apart.

93
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,440
Poor son. Is it more than you can handle?

94
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,270
Try to find some time to relax.

95
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,410
I wish I could have time to relax, Mother.

96
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,550
But you know our house is quite far from the campus.

97
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,500
Not to mention the bad traffic.

98
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,400
The traffic in this country never seems to improve.

99
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
If you let me stay at the condo you bought,

100
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,920
I might have more time to rest.

101
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,560
How about I pick you up from the campus?

102
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,660
It’s okay. I don't want to inconvenience anyone.

103
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,780
But I’m not just "anyone."

104
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,120
That's not what I meant, Mother.

105
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,110
If you pick me up, who'll take care of the pharmacy?

106
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,730
You can’t leave your customers waiting.

107
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,730
But if you allow me to stay at the condo,

108
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,270
I won’t be inconveniencing anyone.

109
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,910
Can you allow me to stay there as a reward for my 4.00 GPA?

110
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,810
We talked, right? I didn't want you to be far from me.

111
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,560
But you're a grown-up.

112
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,610
I'll allow it.

113
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,420
What?

114
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,170
I'll allow you to stay at the condo.

115
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,300
Thank you, Mother.

116
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,530
What? Did you plan this together?

117
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,910
What’s with that thumbs-up thing?

118
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,350
No, we didn't. Let’s start eating.

119
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,250
Go to your seat. Do I have to tell you everything?

120
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,470
Ah, it smells good and refreshing after showering.

121
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,910
No, it doesn't smell good.

122
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,570
Ew. There's a foul smell lingering in this room.

123
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,060
Huh? What’s that fluid?

124
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,280
Ew. You are the source of the smell.

125
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,450
Who brought fermented fish into the building?

126
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,050
Gosh, it keeps flowing.

127
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,700
The smell is so disgusting.

128
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,430
I'll go up there and deal with you. Let me change first.

129
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,270
He was still holding a beer can.

130
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,890
He was always drunk.

131
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:26,150
I’m used to hearing the sound of a beer can “Pok-Ah, Pok-Ah” every day.

132
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,800
I was wondering why I didn’t hear it this week.

133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
What happened?

134
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,390
The drunkard in this room was stabbed to death.

135
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,760
What?

136
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,890
He was dead for a week. The corpse fluid is all over.

137
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,650
The..corpse fluid?

138
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,660
They came out.

139
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,470
Shit!

140
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,660
The fluid I smelled earlier…

141
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
Unky. Unky!

142
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,820
Unky!

143
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,920
Unky, hurry up!

144
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,890
What’s the matter, Dy?

145
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,230
Let me in. Let me stay with you.

146
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,820
Hold on. Take it easy.

147
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,060
What’s wrong? Who are you running away from?

148
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,280
There was a dead man in my dorm.

149
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,640
He lived right above me.

150
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,800
His corpse fluid spilled down into my room.

151
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,710
Let me stay with you.

152
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,270
No. You cannot come in. That man might follow you here.

153
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,660
Why would he follow me? I’m not even his family.

154
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,020
But you mentioned him. I don’t want to see a ghost.

155
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,440
I don’t want to see it either. But it’s better to see it together, right?

156
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,180
No, it’s not.

157
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,990
You deal with it alone.

158
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,920
Just one night. One night is enough.

159
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,810
No. Absolutely not!

160
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,490
Let me in for a sec.

161
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,180
No, you can’t.

162
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,910
Unky, someone is getting in your room through the window!

163
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,830
Damn it, Dy!

164
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,030
Lord Buddha, please help me. Prevent it from coming here.

165
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,530
Hey, Pang.

166
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,380
You put something in my head

167
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,380
and just went to bed like that, huh, Buttface?

168
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,930
Pang!

169
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,300
[Staying with Unky now.

170
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,880
Couldn't stay at my dorm anymore. There was a dead man.]

171
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,770
[What happened? Tell me about it.]

172
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,700
[Not now, please. It's late. Don't!!]

173
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,860
[I'll tell you tomorrow.]

174
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,300
[Ten sent you a message.]

175
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,630
[Have you gone to bed yet, Chef?]

176
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,630
[..not yet.]

177
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,420
[Can I call you?]

178
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,710
Hello, Chef.

179
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,910
Hello, Doc. What’s the matter?

180
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,510
I would like to apologize for what happened this afternoon.

181
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,050
What happened this afternoon?

182
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,160
I mentioned that I don’t like physical contact.

183
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,390
I should have told you from the beginning.

184
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,640
Please don't feel offended.

185
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,900
Don’t worry about it.

186
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,600
It was my fault. I didn’t realize it.

187
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,080
From now on, I’ll be more careful.

188
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,180
Doc.

189
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,600
Doc.

190
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,100
Doc?

191
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,070
Have you gone to sleep?

192
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,450
No, I haven’t.

193
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,540
That’s all then.

194
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,850
Alright.

195
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,500
Good night.

196
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Good night, Doc.

197
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,870
You told me you wanted to renovate this place into a chef's table.

198
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,930
You have the chance to do it now. Why don’t you seize it?

199
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,160
[Is there any dish you would like to learn?]

200
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,700
Will this sound like I’m trying to get more money out of him?

201
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,700
Not good, not good!

202
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,710
Hi, Chef. Did you forget something here?

203
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,150
No. I just have some dishes I want you to try.

204
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,310
You want me to try?

205
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,880
Just in case you like any dish and want to learn to make it.

206
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,150
Ah, I see.

207
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,000
Here.

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,740
Oh!

209
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,250
Here.

210
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,940
Duck Palo, my grandma’s recipe.

211
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,520
The duck meat is so tender that it melts in your mouth.

212
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,060
You won’t even need to chew.

213
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,520
And the five spices used for Palo are top-notch!

214
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,740
Well…I don’t eat duck.

215
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,430
You don’t eat duck?

216
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,490
Then you must try this.

217
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,020
Big pieces of Grouper Fish.

218
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,020
I deep-fried them before boiling them in soup with taro.

219
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,560
The aroma is enhanced with freshly fried Thai garlic.

220
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,110
Well, I don’t eat taro either.

221
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,480
How about this?

222
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,200
Stir-fried Four Veggies Delight,

223
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,300
a top delicacy combining auspicious and crispy veggies–

224
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,650
Chinese Kale, Shiitake mushroom, Chinese Cabbage, and Asparagus.

225
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,180
I’m not a fan of vegetables.

226
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,590
Not vegetables either?

227
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,470
No.

228
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,040
Well, I apologize, Chef.

229
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,580
I really can’t have them.

230
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,300
(I shouldn’t have followed Pang’s advice.)

231
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,910
(I don’t think he’s into any cooking now.)

232
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,050
It’s totally okay.

233
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,440
I’m heading out then.

234
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,750
Wait, Chef.

235
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,270
What’s in that box?

236
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,200
This?

237
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,920
It’s steamed egg, my lunch.

238
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,170
Well then, can you teach me how to make steamed egg?

239
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,710
Can you?

240
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,330
Just steamed egg?

241
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,030
I’m not a picky eater.

242
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,250
I can live on just eggs.

243
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,480
Ah, not a picky eater?

244
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,730
Sure.

245
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,620
Can you teach me today?

246
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,200
I don’t have any plans today.

247
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,560
Okay, sure.

248
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,540
The steamed egg I’m teaching you today is Thai style steamed egg.

249
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,600
Not a custard-like Japanese steamed egg.

250
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,490
When you write down recipes,

251
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,360
do you always include illustrations?

252
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,980
Yes, it helps me remember

253
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,320
and keeps track of the dishes I've made.

254
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,850
How cute.

255
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,290
Let’s get started.

256
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,170
Here.

257
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,990
How many eggs?

258
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,400
Five eggs.

259
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,400
Crack them into that bowl.

260
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,590
Oh,

261
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,270
throw them in here.

262
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,790
What’s the next step?

263
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,620
The next step, here.

264
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,730
Season it. Just two teaspoons.

265
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,790
Then oil.

266
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,580
The oil can make the egg texture softer.

267
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,830
This step is also important—boiled water. Add it to the egg mixture.

268
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,100
It helps the steamed egg come out smooth and soft.

269
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,220
Oh, here’s another important tip.

270
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,960
To make it even creamier and more aromatic.

271
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,020
Chef, how do we know the mixture is ready to go?

272
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:10,470
Just keep whisking until the egg yolk doesn't cling to the fork.

273
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,080
That's how you know it's ready.

274
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,970
We’ll steam it for a while,

275
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,800
then open the lid

276
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,230
and add minced pork, fried garlic, and fried shallots.

277
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,100
Then cover it again.

278
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Stem it a bit more, and then it’ll be ready to serve.

279
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,940
Here’s a trick to start a fire with charcoals.

280
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,130
I’ll show you how.

281
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,350
Alright.

282
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,310
Do you need to add sugar?

283
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,540
Yes. Sugar helps the fire ignite faster.

284
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,140
I see.

285
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,050
You can wash your hands.

286
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,830
I'll take over from here.

287
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,570
Okay.

288
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,080
Just blow the wind on it for a little longer,

289
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,240
and the charcoal should catch fire.

290
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:50,960
Doc.

291
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,640
Doc!

292
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:51,930
Hm?

293
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,620
Here’s a tissue. You’re sweating.

294
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,760
The sweat is getting in your eyes.

295
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,580
Chef, is everything alright?

296
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,600
You've been acting strange since this morning.

297
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,140
Don’t you dislike physical contact?

298
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,440
It's not that serious.

299
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,490
That's why you've been doing this since morning.

300
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,880
Does my pose look that ugly?

301
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,260
It's not.

302
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
It's kind of cute actually.

303
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,110
Why are you using my hands to touch your ears?

304
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,470
Because earlobes can absorb heat.

305
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,130
They're the coldest body parts with fewer nerve cells.

306
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,030
Heat from your fingers transfers to the earlobes,

307
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,830
and the cold from the earlobes can replace the heat in your fingers.

308
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,750
Not that.

309
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,570
I meant to ask why your ears?

310
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,110
I can press them on my own earlobes.

311
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,110
Oh, sorry, Chef.

312
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,330
I was startled.

313
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,630
I didn’t want your hands to get burned.

314
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,250
I can handle this just fine.

315
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,150
Cooks aren’t afraid of heat.

316
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,770
Actually, I have this. I forgot to use it.

317
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,850
Normally, culinary learners don't use oven gloves.

318
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,370
Any fabric is fine.

319
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,190
I brought this just in case you don’t have any spare clothes here.

320
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:45,120
Let's add these toppings.

321
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,330
Woah, what’s this nice smell? It reaches the front yard.

322
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,120
Oh my, are you cooking?

323
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,310
I thought the maid was preparing something.

324
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,940
Wow, this steamed egg looks really good.

325
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,770
And who’s this? Your friend?

326
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,830
Hello. Nice to meet you.

327
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,310
Nice to meet you too.

328
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:11,930
I've never seen Ten bringing someone home,

329
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,600
except his friend Metha.

330
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,560
What’s your name?

331
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,480
It’s Prem.

332
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,720
Prem? My name is Charlotte.

333
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,940
Ten, you invited your friend over?

334
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,590
Let’s get out of here, Chef.

335
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,780
We’re not finished yet.

336
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,920
Just come.

337
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,650
200,000!

338
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,530
Have you reached home?

339
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,240
Not yet.

340
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,380
Sor…Sorry, Doc.

341
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,570
Well…uh…did you transfer the wrong amount of money?

342
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,400
You gave me 200,000 baht.

343
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,120
I paid in advance like a subscription.

344
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,940
There are many dishes I like to learn from you.

345
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,250
Didn’t you think you paid me too much?

346
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,270
It’s not much. I want you to teach me frequently.

347
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,540
Are you sure? I can transfer the money back to you.

348
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,050
Don’t do that ever.

349
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,840
I will assume you don’t want to teach me and see me again.

350
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,570
I want to see you.

351
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,240
No, I mean I’m happy to teach you.

352
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,180
Teaching you helps me practice my cooking skills too.

353
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,900
Then keep the money.

354
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,300
Doc.

355
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,000
Can I ask you again, for one last time?

356
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,360
Are you sure the money isn’t too much?

357
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,470
Money isn’t a problem. Don’t worry about it.

358
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,910
Thank you, Doc.

359
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,470
I’ll put all my effort into teaching you.

360
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,980
Thank you.

361
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,440
Okay, Chef.

362
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,570
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes!

363
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,890
200K?

364
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,180
How many zeros in this?

365
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,340
0-0-0-0-0.

366
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,780
I should call Dy to go out and grab something to eat.

367
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,850
Dy! Let’s grab something to eat.

368
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,830
I’m still unpacking my stuff. Can I take a raincheck?

369
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,020
Okay. Bye.

370
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,020
Prem called to grab a meal.

371
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,020
But I’m too tired to go.

372
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,340
Yeah, I’m wiped out too.

373
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,430
I vacuumed and cleaned up everything for you.

374
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,910
Can I hire you to unpack and organize this stuff too?

375
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,660
No need to hire me. I can help you out for free right now.

376
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,240
Seriously?

377
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,610
I might just throw it all out, including you.

378
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,160
Come on, Unky.

379
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,670
Don’t kick me out.

380
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,590
I’m keeping you company here. You said you were lonely.

381
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,590
I’m thirsty. Get me some drinks.

382
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,030
What the hell is this thing?

383
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,890
It used to be steamed sponge cake from Suphanburi.

384
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,500
My parents brought it over a year ago, I think.

385
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,940
I don’t think it’s safe to eat now. You’re welcome to try, though.

386
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,680
Nah, keep it as a keepsake to remember your hometown.

387
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Let’s have this.

388
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,130
Something refreshing.

389
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,130
Bring it.

390
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,570
So damn refreshing.

391
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,760
Why did I waste time unpacking?

392
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,370
This spot is so much better.

393
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,370
Nice atmosphere, Unky.

394
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,950
I should have moved in with you a while ago.

395
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,770
I freaking love this spot. It’s peaceful.

396
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,920
I rarely see anyone else around here.

397
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,220
Did you just open another can?

398
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,150
What crap are you talking about?

399
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,570
You brought only two cans, didn’t you?

400
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,450
What was that sound then?

401
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,000
Could it be…

402
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,920
that man actually following me?

403
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,610
Who do you mean?

404
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,020
He was still holding a beer can.

405
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,610
He was always drunk.

406
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,770
I’m used to hearing the sound of a beer can “Pok-Ah, Pok-Ah” every day.

407
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,110
Do you mean…

408
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,790
the drunkard who was found dead at your dorm?

409
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,420
Don’t mention it.

410
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,010
Damn, my glasses!

411
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,820
Damn you!

412
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,170
You could have told me more gently.

413
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,570
Why did you slap me? I lost my glasses.

414
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,760
Loud and clear.

415
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,550
The same sound your neighbor told you about.

416
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,410
The ghost is following you.

417
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,840
I don’t think I can stay.

418
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,510
This is my condo, right?

419
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,670
I think I’ll sell it.

420
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,390
I can’t stay here anymore.

421
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,110
Calm down, Unky. Get it together.

422
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,810
The condo belongs to a living person, not a ghost.

423
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,170
You need to stay, not the ghost.

424
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,180
What do we do?

425
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,470
Are you going to negotiate with the ghost?

426
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,990
Do you speak ghost language?

427
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,240
I won’t talk to the ghost.

428
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,940
I’ll make the ghost scared of us.

429
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,830
Have you seen the movie “Ghost Fighter”?

430
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,390
Never heard of it, you asshole.

431
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,590
I’ll show you.

432
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,140
Wait. Where are you going?

433
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,410
If you’re scared, you don’t have to do anything.

434
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,300
Just watch me.

435
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,790
Dy.

436
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,860
Dy!

437
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,510
Damn it, Dy!

438
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,840
My father, my mother, please give me courage.

439
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,120
Dy!

440
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,610
I’ll help you.

441
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,200
Stop it, Unky!

442
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
What? I’m hitting the ghost.

443
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,920
It’s a human!

444
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,690
A human? I can’t see.

445
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,310
Take a good look.

446
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,440
Oops. It’s a human.

447
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,000
I can’t see things clearly. I’m going to find my glasses.

448
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,320
I’m sorry, Firefy.

449
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,820
Ouch.

450
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,640
Easy. Easy.

451
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,940
Leave me the hell alone.

452
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,880
I’m sorry. My friend thought you were a ghost.

453
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,240
I’ll hit him back for you.

454
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,110
Ghost, my foot.

455
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,820
How come you are here?

456
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,680
Yeah, why are you here?

457
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,130
Are you following me?

458
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,200
Have you already had feelings for me?

459
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,710
This is my mother’s condo.

460
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,890
She bought it.

461
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,680
No way! Seriously?

462
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,230
I just moved in here too.

463
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,910
I live with Samsee.

464
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:52,050
Damn. I managed to break free from my mother.

465
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,900
Why do I have to run into you here?

466
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,600
This must be destiny!

467
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,370
I told Goddess Lakshmi about you.

468
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,240
Thank you, Goddess Lakshmi.

469
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,840
Damn my luck.

470
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,200
Goddess Lakshmi, why did you grant his wish?

471
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,490
What is it?

472
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,270
Wow. How did you get it?

473
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,030
Doc gave me this money as an advance payment.

474
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,840
He wants me to teach him more cooking lessons.

475
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,060
He fell for your teaching scheme, and now he's paid you in advance.

476
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,040
You may not see how talented I am.

477
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,500
But Doc recognizes it.

478
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,410
Why did you withdraw it all?

479
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,350
Haven’t you seen the news?

480
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,880
Some people fell for scams and lost all their money.

481
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,490
I’m afraid I might accidentally click on a scam link.

482
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,070
If I lost it all, I’d be totally shocked.

483
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,880
You’re being overly paranoid.

484
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,400
But I get where you’re coming from.

485
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,440
I’ve never seen this much money in my life as well.

486
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,240
Keep it safe.

487
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
Let me know where you keep it.

488
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,310
I might borrow some.

489
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,680
Just take a few bills at a time so I won’t notice.

490
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,180
Got it.

491
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,930
Come on. Just one bill.

492
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,120
No.

493
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,980
I won’t keep it here.

00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,960
Oh.

500
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,870
Cooks aren’t afraid of heat.

501
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,720
Actually, I have this. I forgot to use it.

502
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,100
Did I leave it at his place?

503
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:17,650
[If you see an old worn-out oven glove, could you keep it for me?]

504
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,920
Ten, you're such a noob.

505
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,100
I can never get the hang of it.

506
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,620
Do what I taught you.

507
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,820
Use those tricks I showed you.

508
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,700
Got it.

509
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,860
Come on.

510
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,080
So, how much did you pay him in advance?

511
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,900
Two

512
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,790
hundred thousand.

513
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,120
What?

514
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,330
200K?

515
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,010
Yes, 200K.

516
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,150
Are you kidding?

517
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,090
No kidding.

518
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,930
Let’s take a break.

519
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,360
You’re too comfy here.

520
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,240
Hey, why are you so invested in this?

521
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,550
Yeah, why?

522
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,810
Are you trying to spend time with him as much as you can?

523
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,590
I think you’ve fallen for him.

524
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,240
No, I don’t.

525
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,460
I just enjoy learning to cook.

526
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,290
It’s a break from my med studies.

527
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,880
Isn’t it too pricey?

528
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,490
50K per cooking class for a chef in training is overpriced.

529
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,270
I know that.

530
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,630
But money is not a problem for me.

531
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,160
I could even pay 100K per class if I wanted.

532
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,010
It’s entirely up to me.

533
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:15,900
Got it?

534
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,040
It’s not about money, I see.

535
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,800
Quit the act. Come on.

536
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,280
You say it’s not about money

537
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,110
because you can’t find any legit reason to explain to us.

538
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,630
The truth is,

539
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,590
you like him.

540
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,860
Hey, pass me my towel.

541
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,800
He’s blushing.

542
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,990
He needs his towel to cover his blushing face.

543
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:33,820
Give it to him.

544
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,850
Here you go.

545
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,530
Uh-oh.

546
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:44,950
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

547
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,200
What is this?

548
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,910
Isn’t this an oven glove?

549
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,250
I’m learning to cook.

550
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,460
It’s normal to have it, right?

551
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,610
But it doesn’t look like yours. It seems really worn out.

552
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,580
Surely, it’s not his because it’s written here…

553
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,030
“Prem”!

554
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:10,470
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

555
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,800
You’re taking a way too long break. Court’s waiting.

556
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,020
You like him.

557
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,550
You like him.

558
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,100
You like him.

559
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,440
You like…

560
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,110
What’s that?

561
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,300
[Have you reached the uni?]

562
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,060
[If you have time, please come see me.]

563
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,080
[I miss you.]

564
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,640
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

565
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,840
Here you go, sir.

566
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
What a chicken!

567
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,820
He didn’t say anything about missing me.

568
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,540
Well, well, well.

569
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,540
You’re quick to reply.

570
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,350
You always leave our messages hanging for hours.

571
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,200
I know, right? Our friendship is too old.

572
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,850
We’re not the same anymore.

573
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,860
Not the same anymore.

574
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,560
No friendship left.

575
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,280
The old Ten’s gone.

576
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,720
Where are you going?

577
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,860
What? Are you leaving?

578
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,630
What’s wrong?

579
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,340
Are you leaving?

580
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,520
He’s sulking.

581
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,840
He’s sulking now.

582
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,290
He’s leaving his friends just like that?

583
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,600
He’s really gone.

584
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,870
Just you and me now.

585
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,180
Alright. Let’s play a game or two.

586
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,010
Let’s do it.

587
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,010
Let’s not pull any punches.

588
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,280
Dude.

589
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,450
Hm?

590
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,450
I have to bounce too.

591
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,720
Oh…

592
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,700
I have a date with Jane at the canteen. I almost forgot.

593
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,740
I’m taking off now.

594
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,980
You ditched me to be here alone?

595
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,880
Who ditched you? No one. Bye.

596
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,910
Just me alone.

597
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,730
What should I play?

598
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,130
All alone. What should I do now?

599
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,140
Ah.

600
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,620
Doc.

601
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,960
Chef.

602
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,810
Did you bring my oven glove?

603
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,670
I forgot.

604
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,040
Kidding.

605
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,440
I’m right here.

606
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,570
What are you playing, Doc?

607
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,820
Take me back.

608
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,660
(What the hell am I doing?)

609
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,660
(Do I know how to act like this?)

610
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,090
Here you go.

611
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,420
You stitched it for me?

612
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,810
How lovely of you. Thank you.

613
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:42,170
It was torn. Now it will last longer.

614
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,570
Do you have any more classes to attend?

615
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,140
I do.

616
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,480
But I’ve got more important matters to attend to.

617
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,780
What did you prepare for me?

618
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,360
I thought you might like it, so I cooked this for you.

619
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,430
Thank you.

620
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,470
Sweet and Sour Pork.

621
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,360
Sweet and Sour Pork.

622
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,740
(So cute.)

623
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,660
Want to try it?

624
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,640
(No, no, no!)

625
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,350
Doc.

626
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,660
Doc!

627
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,250
What’s wrong with him?

628
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,000
What’s wrong with me?

629
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,290
Why do I feel so flustered? Why is my heart racing?

630
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:57,070
Ah, probably from playing tennis. I just exerted myself.

631
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,530
Nothing else.

632
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,330
Breathe.

633
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,670
Nothing’s going on.

634
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,140
This isn’t a crush.

635
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,960
So damn hungry.

636
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,610
Me too.

637
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,380
Let’s grab a bite.

638
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,260
Yeah.

639
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,870
Prem.

640
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,520
Woah. Your food looks so good.

641
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,300
Yummy.

642
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,110
Did you make this just to look at it?

643
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,730
Why? Are you on IF?

644
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,640
Or are you trying to control your cravings?

645
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,120
Well…

646
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,190
I have an interesting story to share.

647
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,000
It’s called Destiny of Love the Series EP1.

648
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,240
Here it goes.

649
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,070
Hold on. Don’t interrupt just yet.

650
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,240
There are two leads. They are both lovely.

651
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
One is named Firefy, and the other is Dynamy.

652
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,850
He’s as cute as mine.

653
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,920
The word ‘cute’ triggers a number of swear words in my head.

654
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,040
I'll keep them to myself. I don't want you to feel bullied.

655
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
Fair enough. True friends only speak kindly to each other.

656
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,180
Let me continue.

657
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,250
Firefy moves into the same condo as Samsy.

658
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,050
Samsee!

659
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,930
and it’s now the shelter of Dynamy

660
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,940
as he’s afraid of ghosty.

661
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,650
Just a ghost!

662
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,560
I need to maintain the 'y' rhyme!

663
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,340
It’s certainly destiny.

664
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,670
I’m so happy.

665
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,340
Hold on.

666
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,910
Wait. Is this Dynamy's story or yours exactly?

667
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,350
It's my story. But I’m using aliases to avoid a lawsuit.

668
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:14,530
We didn’t go eat with you last night, so you made this for us?

669
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,680
Did you put a laxative herb in this?

670
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,600
Come on. Who would use such an old prank now?

671
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Actually, I made this for Dr. Ten.

672
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,840
Really?

673
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,380
Oh, sorry, I almost finished it.

674
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,950
Why did you cook for him?

675
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,210
You like him, don’t you?

676
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,200
No.

677
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,150
Really?

678
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,840
He paid me too much in advance.

679
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,450
Really?

680
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,920
I wanted to return the favor.

681
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,690
Really?

682
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,720
So…

683
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,130
Really?

684
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,280
Stop it, idiot.

685
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,030
It’s annoying.

686
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,250
Can I have some too?

687
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,700
Go on, Prem.

688
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,240
That’s it.

689
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,050
I asked him to try this food, but he just ran off.

690
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,660
You also had it.

691
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,980
I don’t think I'll keep it for him now.

692
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,690
Why did he run away?

693
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,600
Maybe he felt he shouldn’t have transferred money to you.

694
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
It was a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

695
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,150
He was scared to admit it, right?

696
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,420
So he ran away.

697
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,880
I don’t think so.

698
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,520
He ran because he got flustered by you.

699
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,980
Flustered?

700
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,130
My gut feeling tells me

701
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,500
Dr. Ten might have a crush on you.

702
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,920
He just doesn't realize it yet.

703
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,800
He got flustered, so he ran away.

704
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,300
Firefly must be really into you then.

705
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,290
He runs away from you every time.

706
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,700
Yes, Firefy's really into me.

707
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,550
My gut feeling tells me too.

708
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,290
Your gut feeling seems off.

709
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,220
How often has it been accurate?

710
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,960
Two times.

711
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,170
Time and time again.

712
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,870
Jackass!

713
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,490
I think I should treat him to a meal to thank him for his kindness.

714
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,160
Where should I take him?

715
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,050
I live in the same condo as him. Bummer.

716
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,790
I have to look around before leaving this morning.

717
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,620
I don’t want to meet him.

718
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,130
We met again.

719
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,180
Hi, Dynamite.

720
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,590
Hi, Jane.

721
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,980
Can you keep some distance?

722
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,910
I said keep some distance.

723
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,120
Don’t touch me.

724
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,570
I almost fell.

725
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,250
You fell in love with me?

726
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,800
(*$&#)

727
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,530
Oh. You wished me ‘luck’?

728
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,760
Thanks.

729
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,260
You know?

730
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,140
Your friend is learning to cook with my friend.

731
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,220
I know. The course is seriously overpriced.

732
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,410
Don’t you want to learn too?

733
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,090
No.

734
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,690
I have many dishes for you–

735
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,850
Secret Crush Tom Yum

736
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:37,840
Yearning Stir-fried Veggies

737
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,750
Warming Clear Soup

738
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,560
Tender Steamed Fish

739
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,340
Caring Cooked rice

740
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,270
Bitter Gourd, not bitter heart

741
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,000
Embrace with Chili Paste

742
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Come eat with me, my sweetheart.

743
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,870
Yo, yo, yo!

744
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,430
Yo, my ass!

745
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,190
Can I learn too?

746
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,390
Sorry, Jane. I choose who I want to teach.

747
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,630
You don’t need to pay me.

748
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,720
I’ll pay you to learn with me. Deal?

749
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,330
Deal.

750
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:54,900
How much do you charge me?

751
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
I’ll just charge you with this fork, you chatterbox!

752
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,370
So cruel.

753
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,030
Do as you please.

754
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,000
Jane,

755
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,470
let’s eat somewhere else.

756
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,730
Bye-bye.

757
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,070
Firefy, your drink!

758
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,730
[Is everything alright, Doc?]

759
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:37,020
[If you change your mind about the lesson payment
and you are afraid to tell me, I can just give your money back.]

760
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,240
[It’s not about that.]

761
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,240
[Then what is it?]

762
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:54,910
[I had to leave for my class suddenly, that's why I hurried off.]

763
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,870
[I see.]

764
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,870
Did I answer too bluntly?

765
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,350
Why am I concerned about how he might feel with my messages?

766
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,350
Act normal, please.

767
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:21,600
[If the food I made today didn’t appeal to you, can I treat you to a meal?]

768
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,810
Act normal.

769
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:28,610
When a friend invites you to eat together, you should say yes.

770
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,980
This way, it will be clear to you that it’s not a crush.

771
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,720
[Why not? You can choose the place.]

772
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,150
To prepare curry paste,

773
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,640
We’ve already covered that.

774
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,120
You need galangal and lemongrass, just in case anyone forgot.

775
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,020
For the dried red chili peppers, we need the big ones.

776
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,540
remove the stems, cut them in half and remove the seeds.

777
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,540
Do not forget to remove the seeds before pounding the dried chili.

778
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,420
Otherwise, it’ll be too spicy.

779
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,420
Yeahhhhh!

780
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,500
High sodium.

781
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,710
Trans fats.

782
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,800
Junk food.

783
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,140
Let's grab something to eat after class.

784
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,310
I already have a plan.

785
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:18,880
What plan?

786
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,730
I'm taking Dr. Ten to One Good Meal for dinner.

787
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,730
No way!

788
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:26,020
Don't you need to book that place a year in advance?

789
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,240
Someone canceled their reservation last minute, so I snagged it.

790
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,040
Lucky me.

791
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,710
Hey, Prem. Can you sneak me into your pocket?

792
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,420
You can just give me a tiny bite of your food.

793
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,440
Come on, you're not a little bird, Unky.

794
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,650
Are you going there dressed like that?

795
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,790
Um.

796
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:45,460
You just cooked.

797
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,780
Your hair stinks.

798
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,150
Your shirt smells.

799
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,150
Your face is oily.

800
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,020
Do I need to change my outfit?

801
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,360
I can't imagine your life without me, dude.

802
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,780
I don’t think that’s enough.

803
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,230
Here. Take this.

804
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,620
It’s my favorite jacket.

805
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,830
No, I’m good.

806
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,200
Don’t mind borrowing this.

807
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,010
I don’t mind, but the weather is hot.

808
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,840
Just put it on. It’ll help elevate your look.

809
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,040
And this jacket also serves as a lucky charm.

810
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,810
What can it do?

811
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,090
You’ll get lucky.

812
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,000
You got lucky?

813
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,830
Not yet.

814
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,130
It belonged to my senior mentor.

815
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,730
I inherited it.

816
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,610
This is the most valuable item. I’ll let you try it first.

817
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:34,860
No. Take it back.

818
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,490
Wear it.

819
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,190
I don’t want to.

820
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,720
Just wear it, kiddo.

821
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,950
Your hair really smells.

822
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,740
Turn around.

823
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,610
Dry shampoo. This should do.

824
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,470
Now the restaurant won’t think you bring food from outside.

825
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,080
Open your mouth.

826
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,700
Gosh.

827
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,700
What's gotten into you guys?

828
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,110
Ah, spiky-haired birds!

829
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,420
♪ Jok Gwik Gwik Gwik Gwik Gwik ♪

830
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,530
No!

831
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,780
We’re your guardian angels.

832
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,630
We’re here to make you look good, sweetie.

833
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,960
Come on.

834
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,220
It still smells.

835
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,120
Ten.

836
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,480
Ten!

837
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,890
Eleven.

838
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,350
Twelve.

839
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,130
Okay. Perfect now.

840
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,020
Hey, buddy.

841
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,770
Come here.

842
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:24,870
Come right here.

843
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,620
Woah.

844
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,720
You’re dressed up like you are presiding over a ceremony.

845
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,190
Where are you off to?

846
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,560
Home.

847
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,780
You never rush home before.

848
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,660
Come up with a better lie.

849
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,510
Or come clean with me.

850
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,730
Nowhere specific, really.

851
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,700
Cool. Then come grab a bite with me.

852
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,430
I've been feeling pretty lonely lately.

853
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,300
Fire's totally in love with his new condo.

854
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,710
He's probably chilling there with his girl, forgetting about us.

855
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,970
I don’t think so.

856
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,560
Have you tried calling him?

857
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,690
I did. No answer.

858
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,170
Think about this.

859
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,070
A guy like Fire

860
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,610
breaking free from his mother’s cage

861
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,360
living his wild life

862
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,000
all alone in his new spot,

863
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:12,020
What do you think he’s up to now?

864
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,890
Who the hell is bothering me at this time?

865
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:18,590
Oh.

866
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,250
I have a housewarming gift for you.

867
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,820
What is it?

868
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,160
This.

869
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,940
I thought you were going to…

870
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,230
What’s that?

871
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,090
A pot.

872
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,010
A sukiyaki pot.

873
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,490
A must-have item for college students living in dorms.

874
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,630
But I don’t know how to use it.

875
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:58,130
Can you come in and show me?

876
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:03,520
Sure. I’ll teach you everything.

877
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,740
I’m feeling so lucky today.

878
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,060
Your imagination is disgusting.

879
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,110
Give Jane some respect.

880
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,860
And Fire is not that kind of guy.

881
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,860
Sorry, Jane.

882
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,440
Anyway,

883
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,830
feel free to choose whatever you want to eat. It's your call.

884
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,460
I’ve already got plans.

885
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,230
That’s bullshit.

886
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,330
Plans?

887
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,080
You just told me you’re going home.

888
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,740
Who are you going with?

889
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,720
I’ll come along.

890
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,020
You can’t come.

891
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:39,860
Why not?

892
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,600
Because I’m going to…

893
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,570
to…

894
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,830
my relative’s wedding.

895
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,160
Which one?

896
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,090
Do I need to specify?

897
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,930
He’s my cousin

898
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,750
from my father’s side.

899
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,380
They’re having a party today.

900
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,810
Yeah.

901
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,400
Are you sure you’re not lying?

902
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,680
No, it’s not a lie.

903
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,440
Lying is wrong. It’s a bad thing to do.

904
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,210
Why would I do that?

905
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,910
Ah.

906
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,450
Okay.

907
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:16,650
I won’t bother you then.

908
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,370
Okay. See you.

909
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:18,360
Your father may chew me out.

910
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,110
Yeah. Yeah.

911
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,110
Why do you keep touching your face, though?

912
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,880
You’re acting suspicious, man.

913
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,020
Hi, Jane.

914
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,690
I have a Shabu pot for you.

915
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,870
Have you already got one?

916
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,260
Not yet.

917
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:45,490
Good. How about we have Shabu today?

918
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:46,720
Where?

919
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,080
Inside your room.

920
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,650
Oh.

921
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,820
Okay.

922
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,950
Let’s do it.

923
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,800
[Are you done, Chef?]

924
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,990
[I’m waiting in front of your faculty.]

925
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:20,050
[I saw you.]

926
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,800
Have I made you wait too long?

927
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:55,910
He doesn’t seem to be just an ordinary student anymore.

928
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,260
You even took him to a Chef’s table restaurant.

929
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,170
Your condition seems to be the second stage of being in love.

930
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:03,580
What’s wrong with Jane? Why hasn’t she texted me back?

931
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,300
I don’t think I’m that into you.

932
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,790
I don’t get it. Why do you always let me yell at you?

933
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,300
Because I really like you.

934
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,480
Thank you, Chef, for being my happiness.

935
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,900
I have good feelings for you too.
