No. I just have some dishes I want you to try.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,300
Just in case you like any dish and want to learn to make it.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,980
Can you teach me how to make steamed egg?

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,180
The steamed egg I’m teaching you today is Thai style steamed egg.

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,660
Not a custard-like Japanese steamed egg.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,660
Hey, why are you so invested in this?

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,660
Are you trying to spend time with him as much as you can?

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,940
I think you’ve fallen for him.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,940
You stitched it for me?

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,780
How lovely of you.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,070
Dr. Ten might have a crush on you.

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,540
He just doesn't realize it yet.

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,520
He got flustered.

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,740
I think I should treat him to a meal to thank him for his kindness.

[I saw you.]

23
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,460
Have I made you wait too long?

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,270
I’ve never seen you dressed like this before.

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,260
I just finished a cooking class. I'm worried I might have a smell.

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,030
Does my head smell bad, Doc?

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,960
How is it?

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,780
N…no…

29
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,780
No, there’s no smell.

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,530
Let’s get going.

31
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,100
Should I help fasten his belt?

32
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,410
I’m just shifting around a bit.

“WHY’S THIS SALTED EGG SPICY SALAD SO SWEET?”

49
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,240
Wow, the vibe here is really great, Doc.

50
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,230
I've been wanting to dine here for a while.

51
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,230
Luckily I managed to get a reservation.

52
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,470
Is that so, Chef?

53
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,800
Um.

54
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,110
You might think I'm exaggerating,

55
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,110
but this place is my dream.

56
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,800
I want to open a chef’s table restaurant just like this one.

57
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,710
Is that the chef who's preparing our meal?

58
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,330
Have you seen the show 'Super Monster Chef'?

59
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,920
That's okay. I bet after today,

60
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,670
You'll definitely want to watch it.

61
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,380
Chef Chang Ma has won that show 219 times.

62
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,180
He's also a senior alumnus of mine.

63
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,740
Chang Ma? Is that a French name?

64
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,660
Chang Ma comes from Changma, an ancient Thai sweetmeat.

65
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,140
Its appearance is similar to the Pla Krim Khai Tao sweet dish.

66
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,230
I see.

67
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,060
Good evening.

68
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,530
I'm Chef Chang Ma.

69
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,360
Welcome everyone to One Good Meal.

70
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,110
This is a cozy little eatery, almost like you're dining in my own home.

71
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,910
I'm thrilled to prepare a delightful meal for all of you today.

72
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,690
The first dish will be served now.

73
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,520
Please allow me to awaken your taste buds.

74
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,680
You can consider this dish a joyful food for your palate.

75
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,700
Today, I want all of you to enjoy the pleasure experience together

76
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,070
with our first dish,

77
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,030
Khao Soi with Crab Meat topped with lemon jelly.

78
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,210
I've transformed it into a one-bite delight served in a tart.

79
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,810
If you like it, a compliment would make me happy.

80
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,210
It’s very delicious. The best.

81
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,550
Thank you.

82
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,630
Who is it? Why’s the constant doorbell ringing?

83
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,310
I’ll go get the door.

84
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,310
Is it my mom coming to surprise me? Shit!

85
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,860
No, Jane, get down.

86
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
Get down. Get down!

87
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,130
It might be my mother.

88
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,410
Ugh, what do I do?

89
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,500
What the hell is up with you?

90
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,620
Oi. My stomach hurts.

91
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,910
Then go find some medicine.

92
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,940
I don’t have any.

93
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,240
You’re a pharmacist. Prescribe something for me.

94
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,630
Oi.

95
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,620
Keep it down.

96
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,170
Why? Are you hiding someone?

97
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,120
No.

98
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,310
I’m sure you are.

99
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,990
I’m leaving.

100
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,720
Hey, Dynamite.

101
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,250
How come you’re here?

102
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,790
Get out!

103
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,190
Sure.

104
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,840
Not you, damn it.

105
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,350
Not you, dear.

106
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,820
Get the hell out. Go!

107
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,570
Fine, I’m leaving.

108
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,250
Medicine can relieve stomach pain,

109
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,880
but what can relieve the pain in my heart?

110
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,540
Can't you see Jane and I are having our own time here?

111
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,700
Don't spoil other people's precious moments. It's a sin.

112
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,310
Do you want to join us for a Shabu meal?

113
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,830
I just got Fire a new pot.

114
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,660
Can I join?

115
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,480
Of course.

116
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,040
No, we only have enough servings for two.

117
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,580
Not a big eater.

118
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,720
Not even a bite is allowed.

119
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,050
I can just smell it to satisfy my hunger.

120
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,050
It’s inconvenient for us.

121
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,750
Seriously! Always a no for me.

122
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,270
Why do you keep pushing me away?

123
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,510
Can’t you offer some friendship at least?

124
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,180
Who’s now?

125
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,700
Go get it. I’m still exhausted from you.

126
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,140
There you are.

127
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,730
Oh, sorry.

128
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,950
My friend is bugging you.

129
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,390
What? Come out here. Go home.

130
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,560
I’m just following my heart. What’s so wrong?

131
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,060
That’s nonsense. Get out of there.

132
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,390
Go home.

133
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,690
Sorry again.

134
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,100
Here it is, the final dish—a dessert.

135
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,620
I’d like to showcase the unique qualities of coconut at its finest.

136
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,520
Here, I present a coconut cake adorned with roasted coconut crumbles.

137
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,450
Enjoy it with fresh strawberries for a tangy contrast.

138
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:56,450
Lastly, I have this truffle-flavored coconut milk to put on top.

139
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,750
Please give it a try.

140
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,670
The sauce offers a sweet taste with a hint of truffle aroma.

141
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,770
Aren’t you eating it?

142
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,210
I don’t eat truffles.

143
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,250
Not a fan.

144
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,830
They smell awful.

145
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,640
How about I change it to another dish?

146
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,770
I have Watermelon with Sweet Dried Fish.

147
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,210
No, thank you. I’m already full.

148
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,490
Alright. If you’re already full, that’s fine.

149
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,060
I thought my food was not to your liking.

150
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,760
Every dish is divine.

151
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,850
Thank you.

152
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,370
My name is Prem.

153
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,150
I’m studying at the same faculty as yours.

154
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,750
You are my junior?

155
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,060
Which year class are you in?

156
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,840
Year class 17.

157
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,160
I’m in my third year.

158
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,180
Actually, I’ve been a fan of yours for so long.

159
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,760
I’ve been watching you on Super Monster Chef,

160
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,130
rooting for you every week.

161
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,710
Thank you so much.

162
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,210
Look.

163
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,520
Oh. You have a team t-shirt too.

164
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Wow, you really are my big fan.

165
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,000
Hold on, I have something for you.

166
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,640
Here, for you.

167
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,620
Thank you so much. I’ll keep it safe.

168
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,140
Don’t keep it. Use it.

169
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,380
I want you to use it.

170
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,580
I’ll put this on to root for you every week from now on.

171
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,110
Thank you.

172
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,380
Do you know there’s a surprise from the show?

173
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,860
What surprise?

174
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,380
I think you should stay tuned and find out.

175
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,620
Hey, don’t charge these two.

176
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
I’ll take care of their bill.

177
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,770
No, let me pay for it.

178
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,960
Don’t worry about it.

179
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,200
I’m glad to have my lovely junior at my table.

180
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,260
It’s my pleasure.

181
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,710
It’s okay, Doc.

182
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,710
He wants to treat us. Let him.

183
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,570
Thank you so much.

184
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,840
Can I have a picture with you?

185
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,120
I’d like to show it to my friends.

186
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Sure. I’m happy to.

187
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,320
Uh…

188
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,810
Mister, excuse me.

189
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,660
Can you please take a photo for us?

190
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,220
Here you go.

191
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,950
Thank you so much.

192
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,950
Please enjoy your dessert.

193
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,580
[I took Dr. Ten to Chang Ma’s restaurant. He didn’t seem happy.]

194
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,630
Why? Was the food not good?

195
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,980
The food was really good.

196
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,320
But he said it was just okay.

197
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,130
He has dined at similar places several times before.

198
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,170
I think he's had better experiences, but I could only afford this place.

199
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,270
It’s not about the taste of the food, it’s about emotions.

200
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,480
Hm? What do you mean?

201
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,180
Prem, while you were eating,

202
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,820
you were making sounds like ‘ooh wow’ all the time, right?

203
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,570
Yes.

204
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,570
Did Chang Ma come to talk to you?

205
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,230
Yes.

206
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,620
What did you talk to him about?

207
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,010
I told him I’m his junior and admire him a lot.

208
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,100
That’s it!

209
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,890
We're avid fans, watching his show every week.

210
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,320
You openly show your admiration!

211
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,270
He gave me an oven glove, saying it’s a gift for his junior.

212
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,660
A keepsake from him!

213
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,840
Afterward, I asked him for a photo. That’s all.

214
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,490
Dr. Ten is jealous.

215
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,480
Huh?

216
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,720
You were admiring another man when he was there.

217
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,820
He likes you. The jealousy got the best of him.

218
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,360
Your imagination’s running wild, Dy.

219
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,780
Unky, you’re only obsessed with food each day.

220
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,200
How on earth do you know about love as much as I do?

221
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,370
Dr. Ten is jealous. He likes you.

222
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,610
You sure?

223
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,220
Yeah. If I were him

224
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,300
and saw someone I liked showing admiration for someone else,

225
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,500
there'd be a punishment.

226
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,350
Punishment? What do you mean?

227
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,090
A harsh punishment for taming a crazy horse.

228
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,600
Your imagination does run wild, Dy.

229
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I’m done talking with you guys.

230
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,350
What would I punish him, you wonder? If he’s so untamed,

231
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,350
I’ll strip him naked.

232
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,970
Enough.

233
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,170
Not harsh enough, right?

234
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,950
I’ll rub salt on him and wash all the slime.

235
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,600
Enough.

236
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,620
Then I’ll remove all the scales!

237
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,780
Jackass!

238
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,090
He’s not a fish.

239
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,780
Prem left the chat long ago.

240
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,270
I knew, Unky.

241
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,410
I’m still worked up and can’t stop typing.

242
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,410
He should have told us everything at once.

243
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,750
Any idea where he might be now?

244
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,480
Probably getting punished. How would I know?

245
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Prem’s gone. I don’t have anyone to mess with now.

246
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,260
Damn, it’s frustrating.

247
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,710
Listen. Your frustration is because of your Firefy.

248
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,530
You can’t take it out on your friends.

249
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,790
He’s spending time with someone else instead of me.

250
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,960
Destiny already brought him to me.

251
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,380
I feel like kicking the Shabu pot now, but I shouldn’t.

252
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,180
I’ll take it out on you then, Unky.

253
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,180
Damn it. What the hell?

254
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,850
Why don’t you cook it yourself?'

255
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,270
How about getting my chopsticks in your eyes too? Jackass!

256
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,040
Hey!

257
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,140
I’m hungry.

258
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,010
Wait, Doc.

259
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,710
Why did you bring me here?

260
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,160
To eat what I really want to eat.

261
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,730
I’m not satisfied yet.

262
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,260
Here. Take this.

263
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,840
I don’t mind, but the weather is hot.

264
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,650
Just put it on. It’ll help elevate your look.

265
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,980
And this jacket also serves as a lucky charm.

266
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,680
What can it do?

267
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,140
You’ll get lucky.

268
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,600
(Shit. This jacket really works wonders!)

269
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,110
Chef, what’s wrong? Your face is red.

270
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,040
You’re feeling hot?

271
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,990
Yes.

272
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,670
Give it to me straight.

273
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,470
Why did you bring me here?

274
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,470
Let’s just go. I’m hungry.

275
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,680
Do you prefer plain rice porridge or with pandan fragrance?

276
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,280
No rice, please.

277
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,790
Trying to limit carbs?

278
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,790
No, I just ate a lot. I’m still full.

279
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,130
No wonder.

280
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,660
Alright then, that’s it for us.

281
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,890
Is everything alright?

282
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:58,510
Ah. I apologize for misunderstanding what you would do.

283
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,390
No worries.

284
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,290
I understand it’s rare to find a porridge place in a motel.

285
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,010
It’s not your fault. It’s partly my friends’.

286
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,800
They put this idea on me that you’d punish me.

287
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,170
And it’s also because of the jacket I borrowed.

288
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,950
What’s with that jacket?

289
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,200
My friend said this jacket has a legend.

290
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,200
The person who wears it on a date will get laid.

291
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,520
When you pulled your car into this motel, it startled me.

292
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,100
And then I saw you picking something from the car.

293
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,430
It completely shocked me, you know?

294
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,950
There, there. Relax.

295
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,640
How could I do such a thing?

296
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,930
Here.

297
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,170
How did you know this place?

298
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,430
Someone brought me here.

299
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,510
To this place?

300
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,840
To the motel!

301
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,760
Not the best joke, huh?

302
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,990
Just kidding.

303
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,480
My uncle is a foodie.

304
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,230
He used to take me here.

305
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,980
They serve many amazing dishes.

306
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,550
I’d like to eat here.

307
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,550
I don’t have to worry much about table manners.

308
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,550
Thank you.

309
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,020
You're not eating?

310
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,470
Just watching you eat fills me up.

311
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,520
You can just have a small bite.

312
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,140
Come on.

313
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,590
It’s not that I dislike this type of dish.

314
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,090
I actually have it quite often.

315
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,740
You do know about where I come from.

316
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,280
I see.

317
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,300
But there’s a trick to enjoying these foods without getting tired of them.

318
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,840
How?

319
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Try this way.

320
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,780
Can I have your spoon?

321
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,740
Here. Try this.

322
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,550
Trust me. It’s good.

323
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,770
How is it?

324
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,800
I never realized we could mix these dishes too.

325
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,660
I couldn’t imagine what it would taste like at first.

326
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,670
I used to think the same way.

327
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,580
I saw my grandmother do it.

328
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,280
I followed her, mixing a little bit of this and that together.

329
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,980
Then I discovered a creation that I like.

330
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,750
The salty egg is quite salty, right?

331
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,520
The dried shrimp spicy salad is sweet.

332
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,200
But when we counterbalance the salty taste with something sweet,

333
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,300
it turns out perfect.

334
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,800
If you want more sweetness,

335
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,960
you can add a bit more dressing here.

336
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,080
However, I’m a little concerned I might make that bite overly sweet.

337
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,630
How was it?

338
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,850
Not at all. The sweetness is just right.

339
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:52,380
We can't judge solely based on their appearance until we try.

340
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,970
You don’t have to walk me home.

341
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,970
It's quite a distance back to your car.

342
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,360
It’s okay, Chef.

343
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
I want to talk to you about something too.

344
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,430
What is it?

345
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,580
Well,

346
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,330
if you’re worried about the money,

347
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,440
I assure you it’s no problem.

348
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,780
I really don’t have an issue with the money I paid.

349
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,030
Spending time with you is worth more than that.

350
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,710
I mean…

351
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:38,090
what you teach me is worth more than the money itself.

352
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,540
Ah, thank you, Doc.

353
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,640
I should be the one feeling thankful.

354
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,230
Why?

355
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:58,180
Before meeting you, I was solely focused on my studies.

356
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,990
It was stressful and I wasn’t quite happy.

357
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,770
Until I learned to cook with you, it has brought me immense joy.

358
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,170
It’s a happiness I hadn’t felt in a while.

359
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,490
Thank you, Chef, for being my happiness.

360
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:28,220
Actually, I have good feelings for you too.

361
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:36,780
I mean I feel good to hear your kind words

362
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,900
and that you have positive feelings toward me.

363
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,270
I see.

364
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,880
I'm home now.

365
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,560
Okay then. I won’t inconvenience you anymore.

366
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,230
See you later.

367
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,070
Thank you so much for sending me home.

368
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,380
Uh…

369
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,500
But…

370
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:33,440
if you also have good feelings for me, I wouldn't mind that at all.

371
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,580
Bye-bye.

I put on a water-block bandage for now.

379
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,300
Just keep it away from water for a few days, and you’ll be fine.

380
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,530
I’m also in my third year. Why haven’t I seen you before?

381
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,760
Perhaps it just hasn't been our time to meet yet, Chef.

382
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,790
Oi. Why am I smiling?

383
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,100
Why smile? Why? Why?

384
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:40,880

Before meeting you, I was solely focused on my studies.

397
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,630
It was stressful and I wasn’t quite happy.

398
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,100
Until I learned to cook with you,

399
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,420
it has brought me immense joy.

400
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,410
It’s a happiness I hadn’t felt in a while.

401
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,960
Thank you, Chef, for being my happiness.

402
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,180
Actually, I have good feelings for you too.

403
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:12,740
But if you also have good feelings for me, I wouldn't mind that at all.

404
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,110
[Have you eaten? I’ve made you a meal box.]

405
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,220
He hasn’t read it.

406
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,800
Be cool, Prem.

407
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,570
Give him time.

408
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,460
Did I make a bad move sending him that?

409
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,710
What’s wrong?

410
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,060
Are you practicing mind reading?

411
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,160
No.

412
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,410
You are acting weird all by yourself.

413
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,530
Reciting mantra then?

414
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:57,440
What a lovely big brother. You prepared food for me.

415
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,820
This is not for you.

416
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,930
Who did you make this for?

417
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,930
Don’t tell me…

418
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,120
it’s for Dr. Ten?

419
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,760
He doesn’t seem to be just an ordinary student anymore.

420
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,890
You even took him to a chef’s table restaurant.

421
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,860
I saw it.

422
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,660
I just returned the favor for paying me a handsome wage.

423
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,070
Is that so?

424
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,730
Yeah.

425
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,950
Not that you have already fallen for him?

426
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,950
Hey. Why are you pushing me into a corner?

427
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,520
I just want you to realize your feelings.

428
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,630
Wait a minute.

429
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,630
Here, this is for you.

430
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,630
Don’t be in denial.

431
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,700
Your condition seems to be the second stage of being in love.

432
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,920
Second stage?

433
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
What’s the first stage like?

434
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,770
During the first stage, you’re a bit dreamy and in a good mood.

435
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,240
In the second stage, you start talking to yourself.

436
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,530
Be cool, Prem.

437
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,660
Give him time.

438
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,510
Did I make a bad move sending him that?

439
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,160
And for the third stage, I’d rather not go into details.

440
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,190
What happens in that stage?

441
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,070
You start seeing his face everywhere you look.

442
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,670
If you reach that stage,

443
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,470
I don’t think I need to explain.

444
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,680
I’m going to school now. I don’t want to be late.

445
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
For real?

446
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,000
There are Stages 2 and 3?

447
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,890
Thank goodness. He hasn’t seen it yet.

448
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
Please give way for me.

449
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,550
Excuse me. Can you give way for me?

450
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
Okay.

451
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,750
Fare, please.

452
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,960
Pay it. Pay it now.

453
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,950
He refused to pay. Don’t make me smack you with this.

454
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,960
Am I in Stage 3 as Pang mentioned?

455
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,440
Please scoot over for the pregnant lady.

456
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,720
I’m getting off.

457
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,650
Excuse me, ma’am.

458
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,160
I’m getting off here.

459
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,670
Stage 3? Really?

460
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,200
Am I really in the last stage?

461
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,560
No.

462
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,020
Snap out of it. Snap out of it.

463
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,750
Just a lack of sleep.

464
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:16,180
Yes, I didn’t get enough sleep.

465
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,060
Are you okay, Chef?

466
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,060
Is he appearing both visually and audibly now?

467
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,400
I must have a delusion.

468
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,200
Is it really you, Doc?

469
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,710
Yes.

470
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,570
Sorry, Doc.

471
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,340
What's wrong?

472
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,910
Your pulse is racing.

473
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,220
What happened?

474
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,740
I experienced some visual illusions.

475
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,990
But I'm okay now.

476
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,420
Any other symptoms?

477
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,120
Let me check.

478
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,040
Would you like me to consult my senior, an ophthalmologist?

479
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,470
Don’t worry. I'm okay now.

480
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:49,520
Thank you very much, Doc.
Don’t worry. I'm okay now.

481
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,470
Thank you very much, Doc.

482
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,670
(How can I say that I think of you so much that I see your face everywhere?)

483
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,460
I made this meal box for you.

484
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,570
I made a little bit too much so…

485
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,380
I wanted to share it with you.

486
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,380
Thank you, Chef.

487
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,710
EARLIER THIS MORNING

488
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:35,900
[Have you eaten? I’ve made you a meal box.]

489
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,900
[Message unsent]

490
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,120
Huh? Why did he unsend it?

491
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,120
But if you already ate, that’s fine.

492
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,100
I haven’t had anything yet. I’m really hungry.

493
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,910
I think you'll enjoy it.

494
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,050
I included only the tasty stuff in this.

495
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,380
Eh?

496
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,540
Didn’t you mention this was extra food?

497
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,180
So, did you actually prepare this breakfast for me?

498
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,110
Stop picking at it, Doc.

499
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,950
Alright.

500
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,140
How is it? Good?

501
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,040
It’s good. Can I try yours? I’m curious if it’s just as delicious.

502
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,290
Sure, go ahead.

503
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,560
But I’ve already used this spoon. I don’t want the flavors to mix.

504
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,830
What do you want me to do?

505
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,960
Feed you?

506
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,620
[Where are you? Have you eaten?]

507
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,890
This is also good. But it’s not exactly the same.

508
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,220
How come? I made them together.

509
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,020
It’s not.

510
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,130
The bite I had from yours is sweeter.

511
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,180
Look. Ten didn’t answer my text again.

512
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,680
You can still eat without him.

513
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,140
I’m here too.

514
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,240
It’s not that.

515
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,760
I text him, hoping for an answer.

516
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,500
I don’t like being ignored.

517
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,790
By the way, I don’t know what’s wrong with Jane.

518
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,480
She hasn’t texted me back either.

519
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,660
You are good at acting. Roleplay her and let me know.

520
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,660
She’s not into you.

521
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,560
She doesn’t answer.

522
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,230
She doesn’t care.

523
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,050
She doesn’t read.

524
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,570
Because she doesn’t like you.

525
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,920
Right, Unky?

526
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,330
You’re not talking to him, but to me.

527
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:06,950
Oh hi, Firefy. Since when did you get here?

528
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,050
And the Worst Actor of the year goes to…

529
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,490
Where’s Jane, your girlfie?

530
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,210
She’s not attached to you anymore?

531
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,440
Attached?

532
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,770
I’m gonna punch you and attach you to a wall!

533
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,230
Easy. Easy.

534
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,490
I’m gonna punch whoever gets in the way too.

535
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,970
I’ll be out of the way.

536
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,460
So tough, so fierce!

537
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,800
So tough, so fierce?

538
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,290
Unky, wait for me.

539
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,910
Why are you climbing on the table?

540
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,840
To stop you.

541
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,930
Sit back down.

542
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,190
Why would you go after him?

543
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,980
I've seen it before.

544
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,540
Those who enjoy bantering and bickering with each other often end up together.

545
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,200
Do you have a thing for him?

546
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,410
I don’t. He always gets on my nerves.

547
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,790
Don’t you find him annoying?

548
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,500
How exactly?

549
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
I still can’t figure it out.

550
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,750
Just forget about him.

551
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,520
I’ve got a more important thing to deal with.

552
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,660
Huh?

553
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,830
Jane, is your phone broken? Why didn’t you reply to my texts?

554
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,480
My phone is working fine.

555
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,660
Then why didn’t you text back?

556
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,010
Okay, I’ll give it to you straight.

557
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,400
Can I?

558
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,600
Um.

559
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,490
After giving it some thought,

560
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,980
I don’t think I’m that into you.

561
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,200
But I have to go to your condo one more time.

562
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,440
I need to collect my stuff there.

563
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,420
Sure.

564
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,560
Is there something on my lips?

565
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,160
No, but just in case you need it to wipe your hands and lips later.

566
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,460
Ah.

567
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,810
You’re quite attentive.

568
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:36,160
Is this how you treat everyone or only me?

569
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,880
(What should I answer?)

570
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,430
(If I tell him I only do this with him, it might imply I have feelings for him.)

571
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:45,190
(If I say I’m like this with everyone, he might think he’s not important.)

572
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,190
Just you, probably.

573
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,340
Ah, probably. Okay.

574
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,890
(Shit! I gave the wrong answer. Did I mess things up?)

575
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
(I need to change the subject now.)

576
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,670
Well, Doc.

577
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,880
Have you decided on the dish you’d like me to teach you this Saturday?

578
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,850
Ah, this Saturday?

579
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,480
I’m actually busy that day.

580
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,860
(My answers might have upset him.)

581
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Thank you, Chef.

582
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,730
Fire, what is this?

583
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:47,760
Ah, it’s mine, Mother.

584
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,140
When I study and I get a headache, I put it on like this.

585
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,000
Ouch. My head hurts.

586
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
My head hurts.

587
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,130
You are a 4.0 GPA student.

588
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,370
I’m a pharmacist who graduated with distinction.

589
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,130
Do you think I’d believe that?

590
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,140
Sorry, Mother.

591
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,550
Who owns this?

592
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,390
It’s mine, Mother.

593
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,420
I’m not your mother.

594
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,210
Do your parents know about your behavior?

595
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,770
Hold on, ma’am.

596
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,450
Did I do something so wrong?

597
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,040
You really don’t know?

598
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,680
What’s your major, year, and GPA? Tell me.

599
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,510
Fire, I’m really disappointed in you.

600
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:34,370
If you want to date someone, can’t you find someone more decent?

601
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,450
Have I given you too much freedom?

602
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:40,370
Go pack your stuff and come home with me.

603
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,130
I don’t care if it’ll make your life harder.

604
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,090
You need to learn a lesson to grow up.

605
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,780
Why are you still here? Go pack.

606
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,220
Who’s at the door now?

607
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,220
Fire, get the door.

608
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,570
Not this time. I’m not in the mood.

609
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,670
Good evening, ma’am.

610
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,670
You should have called in advance.

611
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:11,730
My girlfriend left something here.

612
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,020
Here. Let’s go.

613
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,370
Hold on.

614
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,370
You’re not living here alone?

615
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,580
Uh…

616
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,380
I asked him to let me stay.

617
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,710
The AC in my room isn’t working

618
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,090
so my girlfriend and I are staying here for three days.

619
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,330
You’re living with your girlfriend?

620
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:31,960
Oh my, I feel sorry for your parents.

621
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,150
Fire, I’m not okay with this.

622
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,590
Never do this.

623
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,830
Better yet, stop hanging out with this kind of friend.

624
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,810
Don’t associate with him.

625
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,710
He’ll be a bad influence on you.

626
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,100
Enough. You’ve got everything you need. Now leave.

627
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,570
Go.

628
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,240
Let’s get going.

629
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,420
That’s my son’s bedroom.

630
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,190
We still need to stay.

631
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,390
Fire!

632
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,340
Come on, Mother.

633
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,830
His room’s power is out. I need to help him.

634
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,060
I told you to stop seeing him.

635
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,230
Come on, Mother.

636
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,470
Hey.

637
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,950
Sorry about my mom earlier.

638
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,960
I’ve got something good for you.

639
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
An apology gift?

640
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,600
Take it or leave it.

641
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,080
Okay. I’ll take it. Come on.

642
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,620
I want to play hard to get for a change.

643
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,780
It’s good indeed.

644
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,810
See?

645
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,320
I’m sorry.

646
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
You got yelled at by my mother for free.

647
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,660
No biggie.

648
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,350
I’m pretty thick-skinned; that doesn’t really affect me.

649
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,530
I enjoy being scolded.

650
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:22,340
I don’t get it. Why do you always let me yell at you?

651
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,560
Aren’t you mad?

652
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,750
Sometimes I am.

653
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,740
You may see me as your stalker.

654
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,250
I sort of get that.

655
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,380
Even though I have my reasons,

656
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,360
it doesn’t really justify that kind of behavior.

657
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,060
You know it’s wrong, why do you still do it?

658
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,660
Because I really like you.

659
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,280
Right now, the jam in the pan has burnt.

660
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,880
Yes, it seems he puts all his focus on the main ingredients.

661
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,510
Leaving the jam burnt like this isn't ideal.

662
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:36,070
With only 10 minutes left, can he recreate the jam in time?

663
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,710
Your pineapple jam is so burnt.

664
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,640
Do you intend to serve that to us? You want us to die?

665
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,020
It's charred. Is it safe to eat?

666
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,310
I’m sorry, Chef.

667
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,030
Hurry. You don’t have much time left.

668
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,390
Look, Chef Chang Ma is rushing to get something. What is it?

669
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,830
Ah, he's grabbed some apples.

670
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,700
What's his plan with those apples?

671
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,170
It seems he can't fix the burnt pineapple.

672
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,790
He's opting to make an apple jam instead.

673
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,370
That means Chef Chang Ma has to start from scratch.

674
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,840
Apples, really?

675
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,860
Wasn't he supposed to make Pineapple Curry?

676
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,120
He’s in trouble.

677
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,230
You can do it, Chef Chang Ma.

678
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,970
This dish is called ‘Prawn Mousse Curry in Love with Apple Jam.’

679
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,580
I was inspired by the Pineapple Curry dish.

680
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,150
I crafted a French mousse using prawns,

681
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,950
paired with a southern-style coconut curry sauce.

682
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:41,120
I substituted pineapple jam with apple jam.

683
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,660
I thought you were going to serve us that burnt, charred pineapple.

684
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,350
I aim to turn adversity into advantage.

685
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:52,380
I've been the champion of this show 219 times,

686
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,610
yet I've never ventured out of my comfort zone.

687
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,340
I almost forgot the essence of cooking.

688
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,110
That is to have fun and a passion for cooking.

689
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,650
I love cooking.

690
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,640
And my wish is for everyone to love the food I cook.

691
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:28,140
Chef Chang Ma is truly the Master, the God, the Papa, the Father!

692
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:34,520
The winner of the 220th Super Monster Chef is

693
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,530
Chef…

694
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,510
Chef…

695
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,470
Chef…

696
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,920
Chef Chang Ma!

697
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,390
Yeah!

698
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,590
I would like to express my gratitude to Super Monster Chef

699
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,300
for helping me reach this point.

700
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,500
However, it's time for me to step aside

701
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,580
and make way for a new generation of chefs.

702
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,710
Thank you.

703
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,290
This is our surprise.

704
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,980
Our Super Monster Chef show will organize a special season

705
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,150
to find a new team champion of three members

706
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:42,490
to compete for a prize worth three million baht.

707
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:43,700
Three million!

708
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:52,060
And these are the faces of the new

709
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,040
Thailand Super Monster Chef champions-to-be,

710
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,400
each with their own unique style of extreme.

711
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,250
The first one, his name is Samsee.

712
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,250
I swear to God, this is a human name.

713
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,440
He's a premium cook who meticulously prepares ingredients.

714
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,820
He has mastered all cutting and slicing techniques

715
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:16,530
through his Bachelor's degree studies for over 10 years!

716
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,500
Next, he's the sous chef of the team,

717
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,960
aka Mr. Right-hand.

718
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,340
He likely doesn't have a left hand anymore.

719
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,340
Why? Why are you staring at me?

720
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,120
He skipped Grade 12 and is now in the third year,

721
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,000
but his mental maturity is still at a three-year-old level.

722
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,960
A round of applause.

723
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:41,800
And the last one, I'll have to approach him.

724
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,920
He's the team's head chef.

725
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,700
Despite being only a third-year culinary student,

726
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,060
he dares to open a cooking course and deceives people.

727
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,000
Seriously,

728
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,570
you have such an audacity to teach others.

729
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,240
Your grades are at the bottom,

730
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,490
and your family's business is on the verge of collapse.

731
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:58,590
You are crossing the line.

732
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,910
He’s a small person.

733
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,440
But when he’s angry. I get really scared.

734
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,800
Calm down.

735
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,230
Your lips and hands are shaking.

736
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:08,620
Your eyes are red.

737
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,650
We’re friends. I’m just kidding around for fun.

738
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,940
You’re not our friend!

739
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,770
Look, another angry one.

740
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,940
Don’t raise your voice with me, dear.

741
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,500
I’m not your Firefy.

742
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,400
You son of a bitch!

743
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,510
You are such a bigmouth. Let me slap some sense into you.

744
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,750
Me, bigmouth?

745
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,010
Yes, I gladly accept that.

746
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,010
But I genuinely have talent.

747
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:32,200
To be fair, everything I said is factual.

748
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,190
Why the silence?

749
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:34,260
Why?

750
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,460
Can't argue, can you?

751
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,450
I've left you speechless and frustrated, haven't I?

752
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,900
If you are boiling with frustration, here’s my advice.

753
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,210
Scream it out.

754
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,410
Feel the urge to scream now, right?

755
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,530
Go on.

756
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,060
Scream your lungs out.

757
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,680
So people will know all you know to do is scream.

758
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,710
You're going to lose to us in the competition.

759
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,570
If you choose not to join, we'll just keep teasing you like this.

760
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,350
If you don’t want us to treat you like this,

761
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,660
get better!

762
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,000
So that we don’t have to bother picking on you.

763
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,810
Judging from the expressions on you three now,

764
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,810
I have one word for you,

765
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:07,970
“Hopeless.”

766
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,590
You are really speechless now.

767
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:16,370
Because you all are losers.

768
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,430
Go.

769
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,700
Oh, sorry.

770
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,490
This is mine.

771
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,560
Being a loser is enough. Don’t be a snatcher too.

772
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,340
Damn. I’m so mad right now.

773
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,360
I’m all heated up.

774
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,590
I’m heated up too.

775
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:34,900
You’re furious too, right?

776
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,930
No. It’s really hot, like there’s a fire.

777
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,250
Fire!

778
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,280
Uhg, I’m so damn irritated by the 3B gang.

779
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,150
Same here.

780
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:56,360
But you know what,

781
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,780
everything they said is true.

782
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,190
Are we just going to give up and let them poke fun at us?

783
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,760
I don’t want to give up. I just can’t seem to one-up them.

784
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,950
Unky, seriously, you are not a nobody.

785
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:10,500
You are the successor of Tian Tian restaurant in Suphanburi!

786
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,780
Don’t you want to make your papa and mama proud?

787
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,160
You’re bringing my papa and mama into this?

788
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,700
You are the successor to my restaurant.

789
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,700
I’m so proud of you, son.

790
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,060
Papa,

791
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,450
I’ll do my best!

792
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,560
I managed to get one on board.

793
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,820
Prem, you’re the successor to the legendary hidden cookshop

794
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,610
What do you say?

795
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:34,610
I’m not sure.

796
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,170
What?

797
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,340
Hurry up, Pang.

798
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,520
If it weren't for Moo Ping, I wouldn't have woken up this early.

799
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,520
I'm so sleepy.

800
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:56,890
Here.

801
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,180
Isn’t that Dr. Ten? He looks quite nice today.

802
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,380
Why don’t you go talk to him?

803
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,680
Let’s head back. Grandma is waiting.

804
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,620
You almost cut your fingers there.

805
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,220
Ouch.

806
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,700
Look. I lost my fingers.

807
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,010
Haha, funny. That’s fake. You can’t fool me.

808
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,250
We have customers.

809
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,820
Take care of them.

810
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,640
I’m gonna take a nap.

811
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,110
You’ll be alright, right?

812
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,470
Hello, Chef.

813
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,190
Doc.

814
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:34,110
Your food not only fills my stomach but also warms my heart.

815
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,110
Ten is learning how to cook? With which chef?

816
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,380
With his college friend named Prem.

817
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,700
Since I told you I like you, it made you feel uneasy, right?

818
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,090
If you feel the same way, just tell me. Don’t keep it to yourself.

819
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,810
Can I take a picture of you, Chef?

820
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,680
I’m off then.
