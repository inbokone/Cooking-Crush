Tell him to do his best.

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,490
Where’s Jane? She’s not with you?

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,650
Jane broke up with me.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,200
It’s over like we’re history.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,200
I’m an EP doctor. My name is Earn.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,650
Doc, that woman, she…

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,000
She looks like my mother, doesn’t she?

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
I want to put my hand in here with yours.

14
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,700
I want to know if it will tear the glove apart.

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,000
Help. Please help her.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,700
Doc.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,200
Thank you.

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,970
I walked to the house and saw her collapsing on the ground.

21
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,970
She had lost consciousness at that moment.

22
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,230
The image of my mother suddenly flashed in my mind.

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,230
Help. Please help us.

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,920
Mom!

25
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,900
I remember not being able to do anything to help my mom.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,700
I'm scared…

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:51,410
the worst thing that could happen to a person is happening to me again.

28
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,980
Why is it so cruel?

29
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,000
No, Doc.

30
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,300
The world isn't that cruel to you.

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,500
But you need to take it easy.

32
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,200
Ten.

33
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,970
How’s Dr. Earn?

34
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,970
She’s safe now.

35
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,200
I’m so tired, Chef.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,970
See? You saved her.

37
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,970
You can do it now.

38
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,290
You did really well, you know?

39
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,820
I feel like the nightmare of the past 10 years has finally ended.

40
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,000
Like I mentioned before,

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,000
the world isn't that cruel to you.

42
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,970
Doc, do you want to hear what I think?

43
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,200
Something just crossed my mind earlier.

44
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,200
Why are there so many coincidences in the world?

45
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,710
Meeting someone who looks just like your late mother here—

46
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,970
Isn't this an incredibly rare coincidence?

47
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,310
Then I realized something.

48
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,520
Everything occurs for a reason.

49
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,900
The world doesn't want to be tough on you twice.

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,980
Instead, it provides you with another chance.

51
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,200
It sends someone who resembles your mother to unlock your life—

52
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,000
the doubt lingering in your mind that you couldn't save your mother.

53
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,400
You can do it this time.

54
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,510
You've done so well.

55
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,200
Dr. Earn, how are you feeling?

56
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,510
Why the long face? I’m not dead yet.

57
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,510
I…

58
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,800
I’m worried about you.

59
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:07,090
If it weren’t for you, I might not be alive now.

60
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,100
Thank you.

61
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,310
I’m also thankful for your help.

62
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,360
Dr. Nuea, Dr. Earn is okay now, right?

63
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,800
Nothing’s gonna happen to her again, right?

64
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,690
Medically speaking,

65
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,200
no matter how hard we want to say that,

66
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,200
we couldn’t say it.

67
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,800
Nothing is certain.

68
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,560
There’s no such thing as a 100% guarantee when it comes to people’s lives.

69
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,300
But what we doctors can do is give our all within our power.

70
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,300
And that’s what you’re doing, you know?

71
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:08,500
In the future, I’m sure you’ll be a really great doctor.

72
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,810
Stop making such a face.

Gosh.

86
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey!

87
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,100
Let me go with you.

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,400
See you.

Hey!

90
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,140
How did you get here?

91
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,310
By truck taxi.

92
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,830
Then take that back.

93
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,250
Are you seriously leaving me here?

94
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,300
Dy!

95
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,000
Get on.

96
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,900
Hey! Wait for me!

97
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,320
- Are you gonna let me come with you or not?
- Alright. No more messing around.

98
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,250
Hop on.

99
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,950
You sure.

100
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,780
Yeah.

101
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Sit properly. Hold on tight.

102
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,530
Ouch. My eyes!

103
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,120
You hurt my eyes.

104
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,470
You’re wearing glasses, come on.

105
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,500
It didn’t get to your eyes.

106
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,310
Why did you do that to me?

107
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,980
It’s the strong air flow. It wasn’t me.

108
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,980
Not the air. You did that on purpose.

109
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,610
I’m hungry. Let’s start eating.

110
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,750
They can eat later. There’s plenty of food on the table.

111
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,700
We can’t finish it all anyway.

112
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,270
Nah. I want to wait for my friends.

113
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,280
But I’m hungry already.

114
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,980
You can go ahead if you’re hungry.

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,230
For someone who doesn’t value friends like you,

116
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,510
just eat and satisfy your hunger all by yourself.

117
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,310
Go ahead.

118
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,850
Do you seriously think your words can stop me?

119
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,400
You don’t know me at all.

120
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,980
I want to know how much longer you can endure.

121
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,010
I’ll wait and see.

122
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,810
Why are you staring?

123
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,510
What?

124
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,980
What happened?

125
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,700
Probably running out of gas

126
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,200
I spotted a refueling station at the market. It's not far.

127
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,210
We can drag it there.

128
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,800
You’ve got to be kidding!

129
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,400
Come on. I’ll help.

130
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,900
No need to.

131
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,410
I’m fine.

132
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,970
Let me help.

133
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,010
I said no.

134
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,610
Stop bugging me.

135
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,300
Have you already hated me?

136
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,410
Yes, I hate you like you hate me.

137
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,980
You want to punch me so bad, don’t you?

138
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,770
Why are you pestering me now?

139
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,300
Just leave me alone.

140
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,800
I don’t want to. Can’t you let me be with you?

141
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,300
What did you say?

142
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,300
I don’t understand myself either why I keep thinking of you only.

143
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,300
I just want to see you.

144
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,980
Now that I’m here with you, you keep pushing me away.

145
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,540
Do you have any idea how much courage I have to gather to do this?

146
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,300
Huh?

147
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,100
You seemed so repulsed by me

148
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:57,030
to an extent that I questioned if you were the same Fire who once saved me.

149
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,800
When did I save you?

150

DYNAMITE’S FIRST YEAR

151
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,700
Hey, four-eyes.

152
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,600
Why did you remove our names from the group assignment?

153
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,100
You guys didn’t contribute.

154
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,500
Other classmates never seem to have a problem.

155
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,500
Just you, what the hell is wrong with you?

156
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,600
Can’t you let us join the glory of your high scores too?

157
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,800
I did warn you.

158
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,970
If you didn’t contribute, you should get the consequence.

159
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,790
Enroll in this class again next year.

160
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,700
I’m leaving.

161
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,700
Hold up.

162
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,390
We’re not done yet.

163
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,360
I don’t want to be late for class.

164
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,250
What’s the rush?

165
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,410
You asked for this.

166
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,890
Been looking for a while,

167
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,500
I can’t help but interfere.

168
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,700
Why not pick on someone your own size?

169
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,800
Security guard!

170
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,810
Goddamnit.

171
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,210
Ah.

172
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,970
You're totally different from before.

173
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,210
I've learned to stand up for myself or else I get taken advantage of.

174
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,010
It's all thanks to your help.

175
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,600
But you can't remember a damn thing.

176
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,970
It's a waste of time falling for someone like you.

177
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,410
Hey,

178
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,510
wait for me.

179
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,510
I thought you already left.

180
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,300
I was going to,

181
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,710
but then I remembered there's something we haven’t sorted out yet.

182
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,900
So...

183
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,800
What is it?

184
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,800
Can we not be apart anymore?

185
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,610
(Doesn't he really recall that?)

186
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,350
About...

187
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,800
Unky is calling.

188
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,980
What’s up, Unky?

189
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,420
The hospital and my place are just 5 minutes away.

190
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,900
You've been gone for like 5 hours already.

191
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,720
It's a long story. I don't know where to start.

192
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,400
I feel like the distance between me and Dr. Ten is too big.

193
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,400
I want to cut it down.

194
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,700
But he seems like he wants to keep the distance as is.

195
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,700
Really?

196
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,970
Why don’t you invite him to have a Mala hotpot at my place?

197
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,700
Yeah.

198
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:49,970
Yeahh.

199
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,970
This can help cut down some distance like you want.

200
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,970
Hurry and come back. I’m starving.

201
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,890
Hurry!

202
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,400
Unky asked me to come back to have Mala hotpot.

203
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,400
He told me to invite you too.

204
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,200
I won’t go.

205
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,810
Are you mad at me?

206
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,810
Not at all, Chef.

207
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,980
But you turned down my invite so abruptly.

208
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,210
I apologize, Chef.

209
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,300
I’m just too exhausted and a bit at a loss.

210
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,900
It’s all foggy in my head.

211
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,400
Well then, you should go home and rest.

212
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,980
Come with me.

213
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,410
Huh?

214
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,980
Don’t you have something you'd like to talk about?

215
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,490
I've got something I'd like to tell you as well.

216
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,410
Full already?

217
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,120
How much?

218
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,300
20.

219
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,480
20?

220
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,590
Here you are.

221
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,570
Don’t you have a smaller bill?

222
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,300
No, sorry.

223
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,500
Okay. Let me get you the change.

224
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,000
I won’t get punched in exchanges, right?

225
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,970
You said the bike was out of fuel.

226
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,860
Oops, I thought it was.

227
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
You also want to spend a longer time with me, right?

228
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,300
Genius plan there.

229
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,810
If this were before, you would either throw punches or scold me.

230
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,300
That’s true.

231
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,600
You also realized that.

232
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,400
Yes, I did.

233
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,890
I should have realized myself sooner.

234
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,100
The fuel that has run out isn’t in this bike,

235
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,500
but in me.

236
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,600
I had never realized that, not until I met you.

237
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,880
You’ve added fuel to reignite this Fire

238
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,200
and made me realize…

239
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,080
Realize what?

240
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,700
…that I like you.

241
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,700
Who honked the horn?

242
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,200
Why are you laughing?

243
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,710
What were you going to do to me?

244
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,980
No, I wasn’t going to do anything.

245
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,600
So? Are we boyfriends now?

246
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,970
Um.

247
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,700
Let’s have pet names.

248
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,980
‘Fy.’

249
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,520
‘My.’

250
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,300
You want that?

251
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,940
Call me ‘My’ now.

252
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,440
My.

253
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,400
Louder.

254
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,450
My!

255
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,250
Louder!

256
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,250
MY!

257
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,310
LOUDER!

258
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,500
MYYYYY!

259
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,710
Not enough?

260
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,230
‘My’ what?

261
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,540
Dynamy.

262
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,680
Nice.

263
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,550
Now you know who’s the boss.

264
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,000
Are you trying to make me submissive from day one?

265
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,290
Where did he go to get the change?

266
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,970
Stunning?

267
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,110
Um.

268
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,000
The first day I arrived here,

269
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,920
I felt lonely

270
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,700
so I took a walk around the house.

271
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,300
In the city, I'm either driving or looking down at my phone screen.

272
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,600
When I look up and see so many stars like this,

273
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,970
I miss you.

274
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,110
I think about how great it would be to stargaze together with you.

275
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,300
I never thought I could finally do this with you.

276
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,500
So this is what you want to tell me?

277
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,550
No.

278
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,410
But this.

279
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,200
What do you mean?

280
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,690
I've made up my mind.

281
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,810
I won’t let us be apart like before again.

282
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,500
That day that I told you to take some time apart.

283
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,210
It was the worst idea ever.

284
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,760
I’ve decided to follow what my heart desires,

285
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,500
not what my brain says is right.

286
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,400
I like you, Chef.

287
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,210
This is what I want to tell you.

288
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,220
I’m….

289
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,410
not very skillful.

290
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,110
I like cooking.

291
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,970
When I cook, and if the person eating my food says it’s good,

292
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,610
that makes me happy.

293
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,400
I mean…

294
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,550
I felt happy every time I taught you those dishes.

295
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,980
I got to make you delicious food.

296
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,600
I wish to do that with you every day.

297
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,600
What I want to say is,

298
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,800
I like you too, Doc.

299
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,970
I’m grateful for whatever brought you to me.

300
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,300
Can you sing for me?

301
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,540
No, I can’t sing.

302
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,000
I’m not confident doing that.

303
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,700
Then, listen to the music with me.

304
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,570
[Songs for When I Miss Chef]

305
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,490
Can you stay with me tonight?

306
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,290
Well I…

307
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,820
I want to be with you.

308
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,500
But I’m afraid it'll sidetrack me too much.

309
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,500
Just this and I feel like my heart is bursting.

310
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,970
Me too.

311
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,350
Can you let me go back to put all my focus on the competition?

312
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,000
After that, we’ll come back to this.

313
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,200
Then can you let me hold you for just 5 more minutes?

314
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,200
Please.

315
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,310
Please.

316
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,210
Please.

317
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,800
Just 5 minutes, okay?

318
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,890
Okay.

319
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,800
Your friends are probably bailing on you.

320
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,200
No way. They'll come back for sure.

321
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,980
Don’t try to convince me otherwise.

322
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,740
I'm not like you.

323
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,750
You don’t care about your friends at all.

324
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,710
What’s so wrong?

325
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,210
I just eat without them.

326
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,700
Not a big deal.

327
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,200
I’m going to grab some golden nectars to complete my meal.

328
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,600
Hey, don’t just walk around.

329
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,540
This is my place.

330
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,970
Just tell me what you want.

331
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,970
Hey!

332
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,600
Let go.

333
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,410
Let go of me!

334
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,220
Ouch.

335
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,970
Oi.

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,700
It could.

504
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,410
Haven’t you heard the song about how missing someone can kill you?

505
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,980
In that case, I'd be dead several times over each day.

506
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,810
If you say that, I can’t restrain myself anymore.

507
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,900
I want to see how you lose it.

508
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,300
More, please.

509
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,300
More.

510
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,490
More. More. More.

511
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,170
More. More.

512
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,210
- More.
- Enough.

513
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,700
I have to leave now.

514
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,410
Can you not go?

515
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,300
You must go, I know.

516
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,800
Then, have a safe trip home.

517
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,300
Let me know when you’re there.

518
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,690
Um.

519
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,700
Lift your head up a bit.

520
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,310
(I’m already home, Doc.)

521
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,510
(I just had a shower.)

522
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,510
(What are you up to?)

523
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,250
(I’m still at the hospital.)

524
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,800
(It’s been busy all day long.)

525
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,400
(Patients keep coming.)

526
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,800
(No one here has gotten a break since morning.)

527
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,200
(Since morning?)

528
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,510
(Yes. I’m starving to death.)

529
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,410
(Nobody cooks for me like before.)

530
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,200
(I feel even more tired.)

531
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,140
Don’t say that, Doc.

532
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,470
You’re making me worried.

533
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,400
Don’t worry, Chef.

534
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,100
I only wanted a bit of your sweet sympathy.

535
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,700
What’s your plan?

536
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,340
(Are you going to have some rest?)

537
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,300
No rest yet.

538
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,100
Unky wants to practice right away.

539
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,700
What should we do to practice?

540
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,700
I don’t know either.

541
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,900
Let’s take a pick.

542
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,970
On your count.

543
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,720
One, two, three!

544
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,580
Do this one.

545
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,750
Trust me, this one is better.

546
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,300
(Unky has high hopes that we must win this competition.)

547
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,600
Do you want me to hang up so that you can go to practice?

548
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,910
It’s okay, Doc. I’m having a break at the moment.

549
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,000
Do your best, Chef. You have my support here.

550
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,580
I admire how you and your friends put all your effort into this.

551
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,400
I believe that your team will win.

552
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,810
But we are still struggling.

553
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,310
Why?

554
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,010
Don’t make me talk about it. It’s embarrassing.

555
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,800
Add a pinch of salt.

556
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,980
Oh!

557
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,300
I’m craving Japanese food–tempura, tamagoyaki and sushi.

558
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,800
Take me out to a Japanese restaurant.

559
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,200
Dy.

560
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,150
What undelivered packages? I don't have any of it!

561
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,660
I've never been to Chiang Mai, so stop bugging me already.

562
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,470
I didn't order anything online!"

563
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,970
That’s it. I need to go do my cooking now!

564
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,200
What’s up, Unky?

565
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,410
Who was that?

566
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,520
A call center scam.

567
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,500
(You can share with me. I want to listen.)

568
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,310
No.

569
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,970
Come on. Spill it.

570
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,560
I can’t.

571
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,510
(Not even a bit?)

572
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,470
I’m so tired today.

573
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,380
It’s also raining.

574
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,760
I want to go home.

575
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,970
You’ll get home soon.

576
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,970
Are you two dating?

577
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,690
Can you keep it to yourself?

578
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,710
Don’t let Ten know either.

579
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,250
I don’t want my mom to find out.

580
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,130
If you want to know, come back and see for yourself.

581
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,600
That’s the only way?

582
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,800
When will you come back?

583
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,140
[Samsee: Don’t forget this Friday night, my place. We should watch and learn about the show.]

584
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,302
(It's gonna be a really long while.)
[Samsee: Don’t forget this Friday night, my place. We should watch and learn about the show.]

585
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:17,040
[Samsee: Don’t forget this Friday night, my place. We should watch and learn about the show.]

586
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,370
I won’t wait if it’s that long.
[Samsee: Don’t forget this Friday night, my place. We should watch and learn about the show.]

587
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,600
I miss you.

588
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,700
I miss you too.

589
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,220
I’m going to Samsee’s, Grandma.

590
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,740
Doc!

591
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,610
Hi, Chef!

592
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,890
How did you get here?

593
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,970
By car.

594
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,150
No, I mean, what brings you here?

595
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,600
To surprise you.

596
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,610
This is really a surprise.

597
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,200
I miss you so much. Let me hold you.

598
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,000
I miss you too.

599
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,300
Where are you off to?

600
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,500
I’m going to…

601
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,700
(Where are you now? Hurry up. I’m waiting for you.)

602
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,900
Doc, I need to leave right now.

603
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,760
But you just got here.

604
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,760
That’s alright. I’m free today.

605
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,510
Can I go with you? Please.

606
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,980
I’m not sure if Unky will be okay with you being there.

607
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,290
He doesn’t like anyone to go inside his room except for me and Dy.

608
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,710
Can I go there too? Please, please.

609
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,500
Please.

610
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,300
I traveled a long way to see you.

611
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,710
I’ll drive.

612
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,530
[Where are you, Fy? I’m watching the show with Samsee.]

613
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,970
[Why are you silent and not replying to me? Don’t try me!]

614
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,600
[I’ll give you an earful, you jerk!]

615
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,500
Why are you still in your clothes? Put on the T-shirt.

616
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,010
[I’m replying now. Come on. Whose sweetheart is this? He’s so hot-headed.]

617
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,170
[Your sweetheart, Fool!]

618
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,500
Did you hear me?

619
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,110
Go get changed.

620
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,320
A sec, please.

621
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,410
[Come see me, My.]
A sec, please.

622
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,040
[Come see me, My.]

623
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,050
[I have to go back home for quite a few days.]

624
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,370
[I can’t be there today. I have to watch Super Monster Chef with my gang.]

625
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,910
[Just a few minutes is fine. Please. Please. Please]

626
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,600
Unky, I’m going to grab something to eat.

627
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,580
When Prem arrives,

628
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,600
we can watch the show for extended hours without a break.

629
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,000
Hold on.

630
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,100
Why do you have to go out to grab a bite?

631
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,970
I have plenty of food in my fridge.

632
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,980
I want something piping hot, like it’s freshly cooked with all sorts of stuff.

633
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,300
I’m going down to get some.

634
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,520
Hold on.

635
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,810
Are you sneaking out somewhere?

636
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,300
What’s wrong?

637
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,970
Why are you so suspicious of me?

638
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,900
I’m just hungry.

639
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,970
When I’m hungry, you know that I will get mad, right?

640
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,980
When I get mad, I can’t control my anger.

641
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,840
When I lose my control, I can’t concentrate.

642
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,510
When I can’t concentrate, I’ll get frustrated.

643
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,710
When I’m frustrated, I feel like taking it out on someone.

644
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,740
When I want to take it out on someone, it's you and no one else!!

645
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,300
Alright, alright.

646
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,810
Isn’t doing that exhausting, seriously?

647
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,980
It is.

648
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,810
I exerted quite a lot of energy.

649
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,340
I’m hungry. I’ll go grab something.

650
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,510
Just go.

651
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,300
[Fy, I’m down here. Where are you?]

652
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,980
Guess who?

653
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,210
(When will Prem arrive? The show is about to start in 15 minutes.)

654
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,610
What took you so long?

655
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:27,980
Where’s the tee?

656
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,610
In my bag.

657
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,100
Where’s Dy?

658
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,830
He left to grab something to eat quite some time ago.

659
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,300
I’m tired of waiting.

660
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,100
Come on in.

661
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,900
I have Dr. Ten with me.

662
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,290
Good evening.

663
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,920
He showed up to surprise me today.

664
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,580
I didn’t want to cancel this plan with you.

665
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,920
So I took him along.

666
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,870
But if you’re not okay with this, you can tell me.

667
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,430
- I’m sorry.
- Hey, I’m okay.

668
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,200
Hi, Doc.

669
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,970
Hi.

670
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,100
Come on in.

671
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,380
I thought you wouldn’t be okay.

672
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,920
Come on. I’m mature enough.

673
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,140
Why wouldn’t I be okay?

674
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,300
Come on.

675
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,700
Come on in. Make yourself at home.

676
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,000
This looks so good.

677
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:14,310
Hey, isn’t it better to eat and talk in my room?

678
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,630
Not a good idea.

679
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,720
Unky could knock on the door and find out.

680
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,970
I can find you a place to hide in my room.

681
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,970
I don’t want to hide.

682
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:23,980
I don’t want to cancel this plan with Samsee too.

683
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,300
He’s been looking forward to this day, you know.

684
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,300
I must go back soon.

685
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,000
About hiding, I don’t want to do it either.

686
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,600
I don’t want to hide this from my mom anymore.

687
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,100
You want to tell her?

688
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,220
Um.

689
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,700
But I’m afraid she might not be able to accept it.

690
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:48,700
Do you want to hear my story–

691
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,970
when I told my father?

692
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,500
You don’t need to.

693
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,200
You’re this extreme.

694
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,970
I’m sure your parents can accept you just fine.

695
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,900
Since I told him, he has never talked to me again.

696
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,500
Really?

697
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:05,980
Not a word.

698
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,900
It hurt me at first.

699
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,000
But I’m used to it now, I think.

700
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,300
It’s kind of good to be able to be myself.

701
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,300
I don’t need to hide.

702
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:20,610
I want you to choose what you think is best for you.

703
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,010
But you must be ready for the consequences.

704
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:34,640
Chef.

705
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,310
Hm?

706
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,680
Do you know the similar thing that both doctors and chefs must do?

707
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,800
Holding knives?

708
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,690
Incorrect.

709
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,810
Working over 8 hours a day?

710
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,210
Still incorrect.

711
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,000
I gave up.

712
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,900
We must trim our nails short.

713
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,220
Your nails are short. I need to give you a reward.

714
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,630
Hey, Doc.

715
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:01,970
You should have told me first.

716
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,600
I must punish you. Give me your cheek.

717
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,610
I think I should go get Dy.

718
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,410
He’s been out there far too long.

719
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:14,370
I’ll leave you two alone.

720
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,600
That must be too sweet to handle.

721
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,510
They were all lovey-dovey, holding hands.

722
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,970
As if I were just a ghost in their room.

723
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,200
I must go now.

724
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,000
Unky could be suspicious if I’m out too long.

725
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,210
What’s on your forehead?

726
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:44,670
Don’t wipe it off.

727
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,510
Come closer.

728
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,400
Come here.

729
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:47,800
Closer. Closer.

730
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,500
What was that?

731
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,300
Recharging you.

732
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,300
So that you are up for the practice.

733
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,730
There’s still left. Finish it.

734
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,970
He’s not here.

735
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,160
Let’s find something to do.

736
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,690
He could be back any minute.

737
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,330
I tapped out, Chef.

738
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,730
Get back up. What’s wrong with you?

739
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,350
I can’t.

740
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,210
Come on.

741
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,240
You come on to me, Chef.

742
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,110
Come to me.

743
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,650
Higher.

744
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:21,970
Ouch.

745
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:28,460
Prem, I saw Dy and Fire sitting together.

746
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,980
Fire kissed him on the forehead.

747
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,840
Really?

748
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:33,010
Yes, I saw it clearly.

749
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:37,700
Aren’t you surprised?

750
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,700
Ah, really?

751
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,500
Wait.

752
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:45,500
Something is off.

753
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,300
Don’t tell me you already knew those two are dating?

754
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,600
It was crowded down there, Unky.

755
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,290
Sorry, I was out a bit too long.

756
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,600
Hi, Dr. Ten.

757
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,970
Did you really go down there to buy something?

758
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,700
Yes. Where else do you think I’ve been?

759
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,620
Are you sure you didn’t go to be with Fire?

760
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,410
Hey, stop doing that.

761
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,500
Why would I go to him?

762
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,610
He hates me to the core.

763
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,300
Really?

764
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,600
Alright.

765
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,600
Then come with me.

766
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,890
Doc, let’s go. This is not good.

767
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,100
Come on.

768
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:47,150
What is this for?

769
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,110
Just look.

770
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:52,900
Who the hell is this?

771
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,700
Hi, My.

772
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,970
We were just apart a few minutes ago. Do you already miss me?

773
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,700
Why?

774
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,980
Why do you have a secret with me?

775
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,980
Just the two of you knew.

776
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,980
Am I not your friend?

777
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,610
It’s not a secret.

778
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,810
Prem didn’t know at first.

779
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,850
Yes, I accidentally saw them just like you did.

780
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,970
So what?

781
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,300
You two knew.

782
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,100
Just the two of you.

783
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:31,980
Am I not your friend?

784
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:36,900
I feel that lately,

785
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,500
the two of you have been lacking focus

786
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,980
since you got boyfriends.

787
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,980
I feel like I’m an odd one out.

788
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,210
It’s not like that, Unky.

789
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,810
That’s bullshit.

790
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,510
What was that earlier?

791
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,610
Trimming nails short so that you can hold each other's hands.

792
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,800
Don’t be absurd, Unky.

793
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,610
Didn’t you say you are mature?

794
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,500
Are you calling me absurd, Prem?

795
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,800
No, I didn’t mean it in that sense.

796
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,970
Then in what sense?

797
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:13,970
Fine, I’m not mature like you said.

798
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,810
Unky!

799
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,410
He’s really mad.

800
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,310
He’ll be cool soon.

801
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,210
Unky!

802
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,460
Unky, open the door.

803
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:32,760
Please open the door.

804
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:33,640
Please.

805
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,210
Let’s talk it out.

806
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:36,990
Unky, open the door.

807
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,300
Hear me out.

808
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,300
Unky!

809
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,980
I’ll explain why I didn’t want anyone to know.

810
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,980
Please open the door, Unky.

811
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,980
Open the door!

812
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,900
Unky, open the door!

813
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,580
[I’m not going to join the competition. I’m done! I quit!]
[Samsee has left the group.]

814
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,800
- Unky!
- Shit.

815
00:50:58,890 --> 00:50:59,980
He’s left the group.

816
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,590
Unky, open the door!

817
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,510
Unky.

818
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,810
Unky!

819
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,300
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to say that to you.

820
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,720
I really didn’t mean to say that, Unky.

821
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,800
Unky!

822
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,100
I think you should leave him alone for now.

823
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,220
He may need time to think and be with himself.

824
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,410
Trust me.

825
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,510
Is it just the two of us left to fight for real?

826
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,300
If you win, I’ll tell everyone we’re dating.

827
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,970
I’m not scared of anyone at this point.

828
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,140
No. Wait!

829
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:54,510
Don’t give up just yet.

830
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,580
You’ve trained so hard for this.

831
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,590
Even though I'm not participating in competition with you,

832
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,000
