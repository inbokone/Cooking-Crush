Your food not only fills my stomach but also warms my heart.

6
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:25,057
I’ve decided to participate in Super Monster Chef!

7
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,428
My name is Chang Ma.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,617
I’m an alumnus of this faculty from the year class 11.

9
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,715
Ten is learning how to cook? With which chef?

10
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:34,714
He's probably learning with his college friend named Prem.

11
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:37,798
I suspect you might be trying to scam my son.

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,020
Then stop teaching, but don’t stop seeing him.

13
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:41,979
You don’t have to see him just for the money.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,742
You can go out because you genuinely like each other.

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,474
There's nothing wrong with that.

16
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:46,810
(I’ll give it a try.)

17
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:49,395
I’m…

18
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:51,108
off then.

19
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:33,204
You're probably wondering how Doc and I reached this point, aren't you?

20
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:36,613
If you want to know, I'll need to take you back just a little bit.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,810
31 HOURS EARLIER

22
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:53,555
I’m sorry. I didn’t see your message.

23
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:54,706
I just finished my class.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,105
It’s alright.

25
00:01:58,282 --> 00:02:00,805
I understand that you are interested in…

26
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,502
studies.

27
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:05,983
Shall we go?

28
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:10,506
Wait. I've already obtained permission to use the kitchen lab.

29
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,688
What if we learn cooking here?

30
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:14,247
We wouldn't have to waste time commuting.

31
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:17,703
Okay, if you say so.

32
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:22,502
What are you doing?

33
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:26,598
I'm getting some cooked rice for the fried rice.

34
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:29,305
Hold on.

35
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,100
When cooking fried rice,

36
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,413
it's better to use old rice stored in the fridge

37
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,800
to prevent it from sticking to the pan.

38
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:45,302
Using freshly cooked rice can result in mushy fried rice.

39
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,205
Can I plate this now?

40
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:56,503
Hold on.

41
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:18,091
The dish we’re making today is not that difficult.

42
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,497
So I want to teach you some plating techniques.

43
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:27,681
You know? Beautiful plating can stimulate the release of Ghrelin,

44
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:29,980
the hormone that controls hunger in our bodies.

45
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:32,607
You know about the Ghrelin hormone?

46
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,300
Chef Chang Ma told me about it.

47
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:40,382
There’s a saying that 'Eat with your eyes first.'

48
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:44,262
It means that the appealing and appetizing look of the food

49
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:46,211
can boost the levels of the Ghrelin hormone,

50
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,414
which is responsible for controlling appetite and fullness in your body.

51
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:57,982
He mentioned that a good dish must have all the elements–

52
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:01,001
appearance, taste, smell, and texture.

53
00:04:01,512 --> 00:04:05,364
There’s a saying that 'Eat with your eyes first.'

54
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:08,204
When I learned about it, I found it amazing,

55
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,979
so I'd like to teach you about it too.

56
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:14,808
I don’t think we need to bother spending time decorating it.

57
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,208
There won't be any difference when we eat it.

58
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,509
When teaching me, you can solely focus on the flavor.

That 'Jub Chai Stew' Makes Me Spend More Time With You

70
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:00,948
Hey, Metha.

71
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:01,931
Stop.

72
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,062
- What’s up?
- It’s Dynamite.

73
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:04,602
Dynamite.

74
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,247
Hello.

75
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:13,798
Hey, gray hair dude! What brings you here?

76
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,422
My car brought me.

77
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:17,808
What about you two? What's your business here?

78
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,912
Selling?

79
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:21,106
Sell what? No, I'm here to buy.

80
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:31,980
I’m hungry so I’m out to buy this.

81
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:36,408
I’m not gonna share this with you!

82
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,405
Hey! Unky, get on.

83
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:45,200
What?

84
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,622
Hey, hey, hey!

85
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,820
Don’t tell me you are here to buy sex?

86
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:54,505
What are you talking about? We’re just…

87
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,005
going for a drive around.

88
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:00,505
Right, Metha?

89
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:01,977
Right.

90
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,989
Why would you drive around this area, of all places?

91
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,828
Why can’t we?

92
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:11,509
Our night’s been ruined. Let’s head back.

93
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:12,989
You guys live in the same condo as Fire, right?

94
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:13,982
I’ll give you a ride.

95
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:15,982
Wait.

96
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:17,201
What now?

97
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,502
Have you seen my wallet?

98
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,647
Is it with you?

99
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:20,442
No.

100
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,814
Gosh, I probably dropped it on the street.

101
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,702
Give me a sec. Don’t go yet. Wait for me.

102
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:29,985
Crap!

103
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:30,831
Cops!

104
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:32,936
Cops here.

105
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:34,882
Get out of here. Go, go!

106
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,882
Hey!

107
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:37,973
Hey!

108
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,451
Grey-hair bastard!

109
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,303
What about me?

110
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:48,749
Goddamnit, why did I have to run into the cops?

111
00:07:48,754 --> 00:07:50,493
If my parents find out, what am I supposed to do?

112
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,274
I don’t want to get arrested. Did we make it?

113
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,985
We’re down on our luck.

114
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:55,499
I don’t want to deal with the cops.

115
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,091
We’re safe now, aren’t we

116
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:57,979
Yes.

117
00:07:58,032 --> 00:07:59,240
But my friend is not!

118
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:03,605
Hey, Samsee was not in the car?

119
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:04,616
Damn it.

120
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:06,616
You could've told us.

121
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:10,093
I was going to, but you two were only screaming.

122
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,808
I’ll go get him. You guys wait here.

123
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,007
Hey, are you leaving me?

124
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,410
Metha!

125
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:27,506
Now it's just us, Firefy.

126
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,308
Let's be honest.

127
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,205
What? What are you doing?

128
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:38,502
Sir, please hold on.

129
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,977
He’s my friend.

130
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,977
I just jokingly asked him to step out of the car.

131
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:43,980
I’m a student, by the way.

132
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,602
You may check this. Here.

133
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,807
Look.

134
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:49,702
Are you also a student?

135
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,705
Yes, sir.

136
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,441
Well, can you let me go for a sec? I need to find my wallet.

137
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:57,405
- Take it easy.
- I’ve lost my wallet. I can show you my student ID too.

138
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,263
Just a sec. Metha, help me find it.

139
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,195
I’m searching for it here.

140
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,306
Give me a moment, sir.

141
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:03,973
Don’t look down too fast, your blood pressure might go up.

142
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,401
There it is.

143
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:09,411
Look, sir.

144
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:11,411
My student ID.

145
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:16,739
Are you still attending college?

146
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,514
Well, I love studying.

147
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,514
I wish to collect as many degrees as I can.

148
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:33,303
Why do you want to look into my eyes?

149
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,474
Go away.

150
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:38,407
Gotcha.

151
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:39,979
If you feel the same way, just tell me.

152
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:41,979
I can see it in your eyes.

153
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:43,400
Don’t keep it to yourself.

154
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,400
Hey, you like me?

155
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:46,706
Do you like me?

156
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,494
What was that? Couldn’t hear.

157
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:49,217
You like me?

158
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,201
I…

159
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,882
don’t…

160
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:52,490
like…

161
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,213
you…

162
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:53,797
Period.

163
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:55,703
Is it clear now?

164
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,198
Okay.

165
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,004
You don’t like me. Fine.

166
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,850

What are you doing?

168
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:37,007
Prem.

169
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:41,059
Hey, Prem, what are you doing?

170
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:42,034
I’m going to give the money back.

171
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,705
I’ll cancel the final cooking session with Dr. Ten.

172
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:46,407
Relax. Tell me what happened.

173
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:50,410
Is this a series about cross-class romance?

174
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,703
Do those people feel pity for our situation or something?

175
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:55,200
I never feel pitiful about myself.

176
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,200
Grandma raises us so well.

177
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,555
Why do rich people perceive us that way?

178
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,210
Is it because our house is smaller than their kitchen?

179
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,980
Dr. Ten seemed a bit off today.

180
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,980
Maybe it was just me.

181
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:12,205
It seemed like he wanted me to teach him in my own way.

182
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,979
Do you really think so?

183
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:16,103
I don’t know!

184
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:22,602
Do you realize your own feelings now? How do you feel about Dr. Ten?

185
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:26,706
Well, I feel good, I guess.

186
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,980
What about Dr. Ten? How does he feel about you?

187
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:31,416
Yeah, Pang.

188
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,505
How does he feel about me?

189
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:35,702
- Here.
- Shit!

190
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:36,897
Try this.

191
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:45,708
Woah.

192
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,700
This is good stuff.

193
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,014
Thanks.

194
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:57,506
Hey, it’s tasty.

195
00:11:58,377 --> 00:11:59,506
You made this?

196
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,502
Prem made it.

197
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:03,200
I haven't tasted it yet, so I don't know if it's good or not.

198
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,980
Hey, why haven’t you tried it?

199
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:07,980
I don’t like it.

200
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:11,699
Prem took some techniques from that senior chef bastard to teach me.

201
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:12,602
So I don’t want to eat it.

202
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:14,557
From what you told me,

203
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:17,004
Dr. Ten got moody after knowing that you learned with that chef,

204
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:19,032
and he acted strangely during the cooking session with you.

205
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,681
You took someone else’s techniques to teach him.

206
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:21,976
How could he not be jealous?

207
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:25,408
And then? Did you react with grumpy faces around him like that?

208
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:29,186
Hey, he even got some new techniques and shared them with you.

209
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:30,114
That's true.

210
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,110
I don’t know.

211
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:35,979
It just seems like he's not being himself with what he's doing.

212
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:37,970
Here’s what I think.

213
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,811
It’s not that you dislike his dish.

214
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:42,797
You didn’t like it because you’re jealous of him.

215
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:43,755
Jealous?

216
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,072
Am I?

217
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:45,983
Hell yeah.

218
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:47,600
What are you going to do next?

219
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:51,802
I’m not going to do anything. I’ve reached a dead end.

220
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:53,402
I did overcharge him.

221
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:56,149
Don’t act like a saint, come on.

222
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:56,880
You know what?

223
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:59,625
You care too much about other people’s words

224
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,700
that you take your own feelings for granted.

225
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,300
You're acting this way because you're afraid of being hated.

226
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:08,800
It's impossible to please everyone in the world.

227
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,900
You need to accept that it's okay to be hated.

228
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,205
This will help you release the pressure you put on yourself.

229
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:15,811
Pang, is this really you?

230
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:17,598
Am I talking to a shrink?

231
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,229
Here you go again, being sarcastic.

232
00:13:19,237 --> 00:13:23,106
So, you mean I should return the last portion of the money

233
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:25,979
and ignore what his father said about me, right?

234
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:27,278
Listen,

235
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:30,539
I think you should use the last cooking session to decide

236
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:32,602
whether to go further with him or stop right here.

237
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:34,800
But if he wants to go on with you,

238
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:36,800
there will be a way forward.

239
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:40,391
If the last session doesn’t work, just end it.

240
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,653
It’s better to try than not to.

241
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,509
None of my friends have the wit to understand their own feelings.

242
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,805
Mr. 10, listen to me.

243
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:52,727
The fact that you're upset because he mentioned another guy,

244
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:56,503
and that guy happens to be someone he admires.

245
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:58,908
And that’s making you feel agitated, right?

246
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:01,183
Right.

247
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,943
I knew it.

248
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,868
It's not that you didn’t like what he did,

249
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:07,174
it's just that jealousy got the best of you, you dimwit.

250
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,297
Gosh.

251
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,801
What do I have to do now?

252
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:21,979
I apologize, Chef,

253
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:25,977
for being moody and speaking rudely to you earlier today.

254
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:30,610
Don’t worry about it, Doc. I understand.

255
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:33,075
You were probably tired from your studies,

256
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:35,208
and then you had to learn cooking with me.

257
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:38,640
And maybe my teaching was too difficult.

258
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:40,305
It was partly my fault too.

259
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,708
It wasn’t that, Chef.

260
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:42,802
It wasn’t your fault at all.

261
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,976
I don’t know how to explain.

262
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:47,976
I…

263
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,711
Are you alright?

264
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:55,980
I want to see you.

265
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:59,977
I want to keep learning. Let me learn here at your place.

266
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:10,905
Woah.

267
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,405
Such a variety of vegetables.

268
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,882
Yes. Since you are learning at this cook shop,

269
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:17,977
I must teach you something remarkable.

270
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,402
I see.

271
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:23,976
Hello, Dr. Ten.

272
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:27,106
Hello.

273
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:29,260
Is my brother a good teacher?

274
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:30,626
Do you really learn something from him?

275
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:31,814
I do some.

276
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:34,408
Why are you bothering me here, buttface?

277
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:37,619
I’m not bothering, just having a small talk with Dr. Ten.

278
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,204
Leave us alone.

279
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,309
Fine, I’m out of here.

280
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,404
The dish we are cooking today is…

281
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,705
Jab Chai stew.

282
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,721
I know you’re not a big fan of vegetables.

283
00:15:57,731 --> 00:16:01,505
But today, I’ll cook these vegetables until they are sweet and tasty to you.

284
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:05,208
Can we really make them sweet, Chef?

285
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:08,305
Try for yourself later.

286
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,515
Okay.

287
00:16:10,527 --> 00:16:11,709
Let’s get started.

288
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:17,094
The trick is to fry the pork belly and these veggies, seasoning them first,

289
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:18,773
before adding the soup.

290
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,674
I just knew that we must fry this pork belly first.

291
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:28,946
Yes, we need to fry and season it first to get the rich absorbed flavor.

292
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:34,511
Then we add the vegetables.

293
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:38,305
Wow, it’s looking good now, Chef.

294
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,420
Okay, it should be ready now.

295
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:53,509
Can you put the pot on the stove here?

296
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:11,980
Okay, now put the lid on.

297
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:15,004
It’s done.

298
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:17,702
We don’t need to do anything else

299
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:18,800
There’s nothing else.

300
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:22,659
Making Jab Chai stew isn't difficult, but it takes time.

301
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:24,505
The longer you simmer it, the tastier it becomes.

302
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:26,408
How long does it take, Chef?

303
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:29,970
Normally, it takes 1-2 hours for the initial simmer.

304
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:32,278
Alternatively, we can let it rest for a day and simmer it again the next day.

305
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,517
This way, it tastes even better.

306
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:37,260
We don’t need to do anything at all while we simmer it?

307
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:37,982
No.

308
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:40,900
Ah, okay.

309
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:44,808
I cannot eat it yet, right, Chef?

310
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:48,608
No. Are you hungry?

311
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:52,311
Let me find you something to eat in the meantime.

312
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,952
Doctor, eat this as an appetizer first.

313
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,506
I'll fry it real quick.

314
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,802
I can help with that. I can do it.

315
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,512
It’s almost ready to eat. I just need to heat it.

316
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:21,980
It takes some effort to do it too.

317
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:23,980
Let me help you.

318
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,502
Go take a seat. Let me take care of you.

319
00:18:50,706 --> 00:18:51,512
Dive in.

320
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,979
You go ahead.

321
00:18:57,558 --> 00:18:59,002
It’s hot.

322
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,108
Blow on it first.

323
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:03,807
It’s best to eat it while it’s hot.

324
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:08,700
Aren't you going to eat it?

325
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,105
It's delicious.

326
00:19:26,994 --> 00:19:29,174
You are wicked for choosing this dish.

327
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:30,970
You know it can’t be done in just a day, right?

328
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,508
Stop it.

329
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:34,586
I can just deliver this to him, and that’s it.

330
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:36,909
There’s always a way.

331
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:38,518
Go away.

332
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:47,703
Doc, it’s done for today.

333
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:49,411
Okay.

334
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:52,903
Did you drive here?

335
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:54,903
No, I didn’t.

336
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:58,057
After today’s class, I plan to take a stroll around this neighborhood

337
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:00,198
and take some pictures.

338
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:02,137
Taking pictures?

339
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,838
Um.

340
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,600
Well…

341
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:07,300
It’s the final session today,

342
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:09,269
and in case I don’t get to come here again,

343
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:11,106
I want to take some pictures

344
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:15,976
for when I miss it.

345
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,650
Actually…

346
00:20:21,674 --> 00:20:23,980
You can visit this neighborhood without a cooking session.

347
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:29,108
However, I don’t think there’s anything worthy to take pictures of.

348
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:30,602
There is.

349
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:34,814
Here.

350
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,322
Hey, Doc. You’re breaking PDPA.

351
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:39,811
You haven’t asked for my permission.

352
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,478
I’ll delete them now.

353
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:42,805
I was kidding.

354
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:54,991
(Stop it. Don’t beat fast. Stop it.)

355
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:59,982
(Is this really the last time I see him?)

356
00:21:07,355 --> 00:21:08,505
(I feel somewhat empty.)

357
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,705
Have a safe trip home.

358
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:18,503
Will do, thanks, Chef.

359
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,908
I hope to see you again.

360
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:25,977
Same here.

361
00:21:56,174 --> 00:21:57,500
Is everything alright, Doc?

362
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:59,977
Usually, when I have a cooking session with you,

363
00:21:59,994 --> 00:22:01,977
I don’t eat beforehand.

364
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,402
I prefer to stay hungry to enjoy the food I cook.

365
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:08,441
But today’s dish is Jab Chai stew.

366
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:11,007
And you said we should let it rest overnight.

367
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,007
I'm hungry.

368
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:15,105
I’m sorry.

369
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,205
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

370
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,712
I just wanted to ask you out to eat together.

371
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,805
Do you know any good places to eat around here?

372
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:25,007
Can you take me?

373
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,906
Doc, this is the place. It’s inside here.

374
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,808
I came here a lot. I never noticed this place before.

375
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:48,503
Let’s go inside.

376
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,410
That’d be all.

377
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:56,306
I’ve been here a lot.

378
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,896
Are you okay with this place?

379
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,605
We can go somewhere else if you’re not okay.

380
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:04,903
Don’t worry. This is totally fine.

381
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:13,028
I've brought you here because I haven't seen you try this type of food much.

382
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:14,505
So, here we are.

383
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:17,173
But don’t judge a book by its cover.

384
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:21,004
This place is highly popular and serves incredibly tasty food.

385
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,004
Is it popular?

386
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:26,601
Why didn't they go for a larger shop and a more convenient location?

387
00:23:28,745 --> 00:23:31,493
I understand what you're saying.

388
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:35,509
However, opening an eatery isn't easy.

389
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:39,933
There are expenses like rent, registration fees, and various other costs.

390
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:42,816
Also, there could be local mafia demanding protection fees.

391
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:48,503
Every owner wants a nice shop in a convenient location,

392
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,705
not tucked away in a small corner like this.

393
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:55,977
But for small owners, it's tough.

394
00:23:57,522 --> 00:24:00,408
We don't have the same financial resources as others.

395
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:04,598
You seem to understand the challenges of running a shop.

396
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:09,982
I do because my family runs a small cook shop too.

397
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:13,711
I have dreams of owning a larger restaurant.

398
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:15,980
But it's not easy to attain.

399
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:22,602
Thank you.

400
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:29,111
This is on you if this doesn't taste good.

401
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:32,410
Sure. Go ahead.

402
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:44,300
How is it?

403
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:46,909
Not good?

404
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,968
I’m just bluffing you.

405
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:53,977
It’s good.

406
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,210
I thought it wasn’t.

407
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,431
Thank you.

408
00:25:09,463 --> 00:25:10,189
Thank you.

409
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,088
Thank you, Chef.

410
00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:15,634
You took me here and also paid for me.

411
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,613
My pleasure. This is my neighborhood.

412
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:19,980
I should treat you.

413
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:22,506
This place serves really delicious food.

414
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:24,749
But there’s a downside, though.

415
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:26,422
What is it?

416
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:29,408
No desserts.

417
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,408
True.

418
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:36,663
Here you are.

419
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:40,712
You treated me to a meal.

420
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,508
Let me treat you with dessert.

421
00:25:44,952 --> 00:25:46,502
Do you like desserts?

422
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:47,614
Yes.

423
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:48,714
Have you heard the saying,

424
00:25:48,724 --> 00:25:51,105
- "A meal without dessert is a meal of the commoner"?
- Doc!

425
00:25:52,232 --> 00:25:53,946
That isn’t a very nice saying, you know?

426
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:56,805
Really? I didn’t realize.

427
00:25:57,577 --> 00:25:58,805
It’s considered discriminatory.

428
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:00,644
In the past,

429
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,607
this saying was used to belittle individuals from lower social classes.

430
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,567
The rich got to eat desserts, but the poor couldn’t afford them

431
00:26:06,576 --> 00:26:07,980
due to the high cost of sugar.

432
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,400
They often struggled to afford basic food necessities each day.

433
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:15,936
Ah, but I think this issue still persists these days.

434
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:20,906
Which one do you prefer? We can switch.

435
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:24,607
It’s alright. I’ll let you try mine.

436
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:30,214
Here.

437
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:36,811
Go ahead. This spoon isn’t used yet.

438
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,502
Alright.

439
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:46,512
How is it?

440
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:49,392
Good. Very good.

441
00:26:51,337 --> 00:26:53,106
It’s good to come here with you.

442
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:54,705
I get to taste a variety of things.

443
00:26:56,096 --> 00:26:58,797
Who do you normally come here with?

444
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:00,111
Alone.

445
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:04,902
What about those two friends of yours?

446
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:07,205
Those two don’t like desserts.

447
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:08,604
They always go for booze.

448
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:11,306
No one likes desserts?

449
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:15,602
There is.

450
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,801
You.

451
00:27:27,976 --> 00:27:29,146
- What are you looking at? Keep eating.
- Ouch.

452
00:27:29,568 --> 00:27:31,408
Sorry, Doc! I didn’t mean it.

453
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:32,600
Did I hurt you?

454
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:38,706
I’m fine.

455
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:40,908
I was overreacting.

456
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,908
I was scared for real.

457
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:47,700
You are a good actor.

458
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:49,977
You seem reserved and collected.

459
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:51,414
Never thought you could be like this too.

460
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:55,634
Do you want to try mine?

461
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,608
Let me feed you.

462
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:28,712
It’s already 9.

463
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:30,905
Do you have to go anywhere else?

464
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:33,208
No. What about you?

465
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:34,508
No.

466
00:28:34,976 --> 00:28:36,202
Where should we go after this?

467
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:55,103
What are we doing here?

468
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,712
I also wonder.

469
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:06,807
Sometimes, people get carried away without even realizing it.

470
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:17,087
(But if he wants to go on with you,)

471
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,105
(there will be a way forward.)

472
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:25,506
I still have no idea what I'll be doing next Saturday

473
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:27,979
since I don't have a cooking class with you.

474
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,605
I think your studies should be harder than mine.

475
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:37,108
Why don’t you take some time off to relax?

476
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:42,505
The time I spend with you is like a time to relax for me.

477
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:53,805
I mean relaxing in a way like taking a walk or watching a movie.

478
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,505
You don’t really need to walk me home.

479
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:31,881
You came to my place for the last time,

480
00:31:31,897 --> 00:31:34,208
so I want to come to see your place for the last time as well.

481
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:39,007
I won’t get to see you ever again?

482
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:43,205
Well…

483
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:48,900
When you run into me on campus, please come say hi.

484
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:57,402
I’m…

485
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,200
off then.

486
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:07,605

00:33:47,537 --> 00:33:48,608
You’re here.

498
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:50,204
I’ve been waiting for you for quite a while.

499
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:53,300
Good gracious!

500
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:00,703
What do you think, Chef?

501
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,275
Totally stunned, shocked and flabbergasted, right?

502
00:34:03,284 --> 00:34:07,204
I’m wearing clothes that suit this occasion and location.

503
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:08,205
Breezy attire.

504
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,573
No worries about getting dirty,

505
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:11,210
Just one wash, and that’s it.

506
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:13,205
I haven't said anything yet.

507
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:15,979
I just didn't expect to see this side of yours.

508
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:19,232
I have several other sides that you’ve never seen.

509
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,503
How did you know I would come here?

510
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:25,311
You mentioned you visit the market every two days.

511
00:34:25,407 --> 00:34:27,805
I calculated from that day. So today is your market day.

512
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:31,059
You could even remember that?

513
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:31,808
Um.

514
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:33,712
Let’s go.

515
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:40,654
When choosing Chinese Kale, you need to look at the cut in the stem.

516
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:43,792
If you see a light white line, that means it’s not too old.

517
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:47,974
Are you sleepy?

518
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:49,965
No.

519
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,398
I just didn’t get enough sleep last night.

520
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:53,407
Why?

521
00:34:54,362 --> 00:34:56,202
I was just counting down the moments till morning.

522
00:34:56,546 --> 00:34:58,260
I was missing you, wanting to see you.

523
00:34:58,383 --> 00:35:00,604
Aren’t we going to talk about what happened last night?

524
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:04,306
Let’s check out other stalls.

525
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:15,208
Here you go, Prof.

526
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:25,305
Very nice.

527
00:35:25,678 --> 00:35:26,613
Refreshing.

528
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:27,980
A nice ending to a meal.

529
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,306
Did you use Seville orange?

530
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,992
Well, I used lemon, lime, and kaffir lime to create a taste resembling Seville orange.

531
00:35:35,004 --> 00:35:38,411
It's refreshing and revitalizing for a good morning.

532
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:41,977
You are still very good at adapting techniques.

533
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,308
Thank you.

534
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,514
You know, you're an idol to many students at the faculty.

535
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:49,706
They all aspire to be like Chef Chang Ma.

536
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:54,210
But I believe many students possess genuine talents.

537
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:57,890
Some of them may even qualify to participate in Super Monster Chef.

538
00:35:57,903 --> 00:36:02,520
Yeah, there's one who might come off as overly confident.

539
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:03,407
His name is Boon.

540
00:36:03,598 --> 00:36:06,121
He exudes confidence and tends to belittle others.

541
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:11,810
If he joins the show, he could certainly add some spice to it.

542
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,722
Prof, what about Prem?

543
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:18,979
I was just going to ask if you knew Premmatat?

544
00:36:20,918 --> 00:36:26,242
He visited here, so I had the chance to meet and chat with him briefly.

545
00:36:26,257 --> 00:36:30,514
Just briefly? You seemed quite interested in him that day.

546
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:38,238
On the fourth? Sure.

547
00:36:38,271 --> 00:36:39,611
Okay, thank you.

548
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,442
Thank you.

549
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:44,207
Good morning, ma’am.

550
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:45,505
Good morning.

551
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,706
Are you here today too?

552
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:51,214
Dr. Ten regularly jogs in this area every morning.

553
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:53,979
Jogging?

554
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:59,635
These jogging shoes don't get stuffy or messy.

555
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:02,308
Just one wash, and they're as fresh as new.

556
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:04,552
Do you really expect me to believe that?

557
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:07,804
I'm not here for jogging today.

558
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:09,980
I’m here to pick up the Jab Chai stew from yesterday's lesson.

559
00:37:11,918 --> 00:37:12,804
See?

560
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,977
You’re the one making up stories and acting suspicious.

561
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:17,708
Anyway, have you eaten yet?

562
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:18,906
Not yet.

563
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,482
He helped carry stuff for you.

564
00:37:21,494 --> 00:37:23,100
Go heat up the stew for him.

565
00:37:38,574 --> 00:37:39,505
Doc!

566
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:41,705
I want to freshen up you.

567
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,207
Here.

568
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:49,974
Grandma is in the house.

569
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,160
She won’t come out here.

570
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:53,977
Come on.

571
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:31,977
I’m hungry. Can I eat it yet?

572
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:33,346
Just a sec.

573
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:38,903
Nice smell

574
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:40,705
both of Jab Chai

575
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:43,198
and you.

576
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,595
Behave or else I sniff…

577
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,797
Sniff this or this?

578
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:54,705
This one is gold.

579
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,905
This one is also gold.

580
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:00,602
Where to see the size?

581
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:01,896
At the bottom?

582
00:39:03,112 --> 00:39:03,977
Nah.

583
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,405
Just grab one.

584
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:08,605
Look, there’s this too.

585
00:39:08,774 --> 00:39:09,801
What about a phone sim?

586
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,108
Burn a phone sim with it too.

587
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,041
Yeah, or else it can’t be used over there.

588
00:39:13,595 --> 00:39:15,311
Hasn't the Ghost Festival ended?

589
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:17,816
We can still burn them on a special occasion

590
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:19,271
to ask for our ancestors' blessings,

591
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:22,509
“Help us qualify for the competition, please.”

592
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:24,060
Let’s just perform this ritual.

593
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,508
Take them all.

594
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:28,205
These look great.

595
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:29,979
Do you want anything else?

596
00:39:32,117 --> 00:39:33,395
Hey, Dy.

597
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:34,847
That’s your Firefy.

598
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:35,623
Where?

599
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:40,364
Darn it.

600
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:43,309
How come he’s here too.

601
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:45,602
He must have been following me.

602
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:51,008
Jane, if he comes here, may I give him a good scolding?

603
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:02,407
I’ll go check on some other things.

604
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,623
He’s not coming to me?

605
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:11,014
Isn’t it a good thing?

606
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:13,385
You find him annoying, don’t you?

607
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:15,977
Yeah.

608
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,503
You’re right.

609
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,854
Let’s continue our shopping.

610
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:37,977
Is something bothering you?

611
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,204
No, I’m fine.

612
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,804
If you're thinking about him, give him a call.

613
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,208
Don't just sneakily look around for him like this.

614
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,422
What are you talking about? I’m not thinking about him.

615
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:53,105
Just be honest and admit it.

616
00:41:00,354 --> 00:41:01,109
Hey.

617
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:03,109
Don't look away.

618
00:41:03,948 --> 00:41:05,700
Why do you want to look into my eyes?

619
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,900
Gotcha.

620
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:09,574
If you feel the same way, just tell me.

621
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,401
I…

622
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:11,985
don’t…

623
00:41:12,146 --> 00:41:12,745
like…

624
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:13,456
you…

625
00:41:13,477 --> 00:41:14,200
Period.

626
00:41:14,663 --> 00:41:15,512
Okay.

627
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,303
You don’t like me. Fine.

628
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:30,204
I’ll go check on some other things.

629
00:41:37,903 --> 00:41:42,205
I actually know that you are not that serious about me.

630
00:41:43,623 --> 00:41:46,804
You're still hesitant to accept it and concerned about your mother, right?

631
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,208
Gosh, they are all veggies.

632
00:41:57,711 --> 00:41:59,503
Try it. Don’t be afraid.

633
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:03,005
Are you sure it won’t taste bitter and grassy?

634
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,891
Trust me.

635
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,204
I'm sweet. Eat me.

636
00:42:41,448 --> 00:42:42,608
It's surprisingly sweet.

637
00:42:43,171 --> 00:42:44,909
See? I told you.

638
00:42:46,078 --> 00:42:47,808
How could you do it?

639
00:42:47,925 --> 00:42:50,305
If I'd known, I would've eaten veggies since I was small.

640
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:51,807
Have some more.

641
00:43:01,032 --> 00:43:02,305
Hello, what’s up?

642
00:43:02,638 --> 00:43:05,005
(We’re almost there. Have you bought everything?)

643
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:09,208
Almost where? What do I need to buy?

644
00:43:09,779 --> 00:43:11,977
(We’re recording our audition clip at your place today.)

645
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:13,423
(Didn’t you remember?)

646
00:43:16,254 --> 00:43:17,875
This Saturday, okay?

647
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:19,980
We need to film and edit too, or it'll be too late.

648
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,980
Where? At Prem's place?

649
00:43:21,986 --> 00:43:23,192
Yes, at Prem's place.

650
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:25,613
Your condo isn't ideal. Can we go there?

651
00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:27,204
Um, you can.

652
00:43:30,017 --> 00:43:30,902
"We can" what?

653
00:43:32,296 --> 00:43:34,705
You can do as you said.

654
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:36,300
What was it again?

655
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:37,659
You just agreed for the sake of it.

656
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:40,065
Are you not taking our audition clip seriously?

657
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,703
Hey, relax. Why so worked up?

658
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:46,035
Forget whatever's bothering you right now.

659
00:43:46,048 --> 00:43:48,798
The only thing that you need to focus on is making the audition clip.

660
00:43:48,882 --> 00:43:52,608
Don't let anything or anyone distract you, ever!

661
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,653
What if I see you chasing after Firefy?

662
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,552
I would never

663
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:56,382
do that

664
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:57,317
ever again.

665
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,906
Whatcha doin’?

666
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,352
Gosh, that hurts.

667
00:44:08,786 --> 00:44:10,936
Ah, ‘cause they’re back together.

668
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:12,943
All unimportant matters must be cut out.

669
00:44:13,065 --> 00:44:14,765
I could even cut out love.

670
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,028
You all must do the same.

671
00:44:16,188 --> 00:44:19,677
Never let anything distract, bother, irritate, or annoy you.

672
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:20,514
I don’t like that.

673
00:44:20,528 --> 00:44:21,662
Understand?

674
00:44:21,717 --> 00:44:23,105
Yes, I understand!

675
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,702
Do you understand?

676
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:25,982
Alright.

677
00:44:27,817 --> 00:44:29,010
I’m screwed!

678
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:30,309
Who?

679
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:31,413
(Who’s that?)

680
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:36,404
Nothing. I was just gonna say that I remember that you’re coming here.

681
00:44:36,602 --> 00:44:38,404
Where are you now?

682
00:44:38,505 --> 00:44:39,813
(On our way to your place.)

683
00:44:39,983 --> 00:44:41,197
(Should be there in 5 minutes.)

684
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,216
Holy shit.

685
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,087
(Why so surprised?)

686
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,256
(You sound suspicious.)

687
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:48,397
Nothing. Just that I haven’t showered yet.

688
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:49,410
I’ve got to go now.

689
00:44:50,248 --> 00:44:51,783
Doc, you need to go home now.

690
00:44:51,795 --> 00:44:53,016
My friends are coming.

691
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,016
That’s fine. What are they here for?

692
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:57,770
To shoot an audition clip to apply for Super Monster Chef.

693
00:44:57,783 --> 00:44:59,237
I’m free today. Let me help.

694
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:00,191
No, you can’t.

695
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:01,383
Why not?

696
00:45:01,397 --> 00:45:06,164
If Dy sees you here, he’ll scold me for losing focus and getting sidetracked,

697
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:07,570
assuming I spend all my time with you.

698
00:45:07,582 --> 00:45:09,037
I don’t want to deal with that.

699
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:10,595
He can get really bothersome and whiny.

700
00:45:10,605 --> 00:45:11,585
Just go, please.

701
00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:12,705
But I’m not full yet.

702
00:45:12,717 --> 00:45:14,245
- Come back for it later.
- I want to have more.

703
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:16,131
No. You can have more later. I’ll make a new one for you.

704
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:17,475
- Go, please go.
- Okay, fine.

705
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:19,000
Quickly. Move.

706
00:45:19,785 --> 00:45:21,512
I heard someone talking.

707
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:23,619
Too late, Doc.

708
00:45:23,631 --> 00:45:24,751
Find a spot to hide.

709
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:26,506
Upstairs. Go!

710
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,567
Chef, my slippers.

711
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:30,813
Here they are.

712
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,204
Hurry, Doc.

713
00:45:35,928 --> 00:45:36,914
Hello, Prem.

714
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:37,976
Hi, Unky.

715
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:40,909
You look suspicious.

716
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,302
You said you haven’t showered.

717
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,405
I've been wearing this since last night.

718
00:45:50,392 --> 00:45:52,514
What’s with you? Move, it’s hot.

719
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:55,979
Move!

720
00:45:57,361 --> 00:45:58,303
It's heavy.

721
00:46:03,582 --> 00:46:04,909
I should hide here.

722
00:46:08,314 --> 00:46:11,608
What? I just stitched it. It got torn again?

723
00:46:12,591 --> 00:46:13,608
Who’s that?

724
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:18,774
Sorry. I didn't know there was someone here.

725
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:20,040
I’m trying to hide from Prem’s friends.

726
00:46:20,051 --> 00:46:21,108
Where can I be?

727
00:46:22,143 --> 00:46:24,903
This way. I always sneak out from Grandma through here.

728
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,891
-This window?
- Yes.

729
00:46:27,638 --> 00:46:28,903
Hurry up.

730
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:30,804
Go, go.

731
00:46:44,474 --> 00:46:45,506
What are you searching for?

732
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:47,974
A rat.

733
00:46:47,982 --> 00:46:50,411
Grandma said she saw a rat inside.

734
00:46:52,066 --> 00:46:52,844
Prem.

735
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:55,928
Good morning, ma’am.

736
00:46:55,936 --> 00:46:57,198
Morning.

737
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:01,407
You’re busy? Fine, let’s talk later.

738
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:13,697
Prem, is your grandma okay today?

739
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,604
Usually, she likes to tease me and squeeze my tummy.

740
00:47:18,048 --> 00:47:19,111
Is she sick?

741
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,002
She’s fine.

742
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,010
[I managed to get out of the house.]

743
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,330
[How?]

744
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,930
[Your sister showed me the way out through the window.]

745
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,330
[Let’s talk later.]

746
00:47:37,842 --> 00:47:38,705
Give it to me.

747
00:47:39,383 --> 00:47:40,303
Take this.

748
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:44,400
This is my idea.

749
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:47,976
Our audition clip must catch attention from the first watch.

750
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:49,804
The food must be visually stunning.

751
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:53,000
More importantly, the first 5 seconds must hit home!

752
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:29,088
Cut.

753
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,976
Why so soon? I haven’t sung the hook part yet.

754
00:48:32,149 --> 00:48:34,500
You walk too slowly. You’ve already spent like 5 minutes.

755
00:48:34,952 --> 00:48:37,105
It’s not easy to walk in this.

756
00:48:43,034 --> 00:48:43,903
Hey!

757
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:45,400
Look.

758
00:48:46,906 --> 00:48:49,376
Your sister is using my picture for a meme for sure.

759
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:52,414
What did I do to deserve this?

760
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:53,605
She won’t do that.

761
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:56,810
Why do we have to be in these costumes?

762
00:48:57,008 --> 00:48:59,192
Can’t we focus more on our culinary artistry?

763
00:48:59,205 --> 00:48:59,979
Yeah.

764
00:49:00,328 --> 00:49:03,871
We’ll get to that later. Just the first 5 seconds must be captivating.

765
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:05,201
It will draw attention.

766
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,974
When people see the clip, they will think “What are they doing?”

767
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:09,974
“Oh they have some culinary talents too.”

768
00:49:10,004 --> 00:49:11,088
They will hit the Like button repeatedly.

769
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:11,977
You think?

770
00:49:12,155 --> 00:49:13,306
People will really say that?

771
00:49:15,045 --> 00:49:15,976
Let’s pack these up.

772
00:49:16,765 --> 00:49:17,976
All good yet?

773
00:49:21,515 --> 00:49:24,408
I just learned from Professor Chef that this is your place.

774
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:27,977
I should have made a reservation so that I could eat too.

775
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,293
Hello.

776
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,600
Hi.

777
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:33,706
Grandma can't work for extended hours,

778
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:35,308
so she only takes customers with reservations.

779
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:39,976
Let me see.

780
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:41,601
See? It’s too slow.

781
00:49:44,391 --> 00:49:46,509
At least my visit is not completely in vain.

782
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,805
I get to observe your audition clip making.

783
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:53,610
You’re roleplaying celebrity chefs, right?

784
00:49:54,405 --> 00:49:55,974
Ah, Jay Fai.

785
00:49:57,002 --> 00:49:58,708
And you’re Salt Bae.

786
00:50:00,894 --> 00:50:03,303
Uh…and you’re…

787
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:07,192
I’m the head chef of this royal kitchen.

788
00:50:07,345 --> 00:50:09,404
Dae Jang Geum.

789
00:50:10,277 --> 00:50:11,432
Dae Jang Geum?

790
00:50:12,299 --> 00:50:15,521
If I remember correctly, she was not a chef in the end.

791
00:50:15,714 --> 00:50:17,005
She became the supreme royal physician.

792
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:19,977
Shoot.

793
00:50:20,671 --> 00:50:22,349
Turns out she’s a physician?

794
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:29,702
That’s why I’m arguing that this won’t work.

795
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:31,245
We need a new idea and reshoot.

796
00:50:32,605 --> 00:50:35,503
Chef Chang Ma, do you happen to have an idea for us?

797
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,708
Alright, let me help you.

798
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:46,805
If he helps us, won't that give us an advantage over other teams?

799
00:50:47,485 --> 00:50:48,894
Don’t think about that, dear.

800
00:50:48,914 --> 00:50:50,973
Chef Chang Ma is a kind man.

801
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:53,008
We shouldn’t stop his willingness to help.

802
00:50:55,022 --> 00:50:57,875
You all need to find inspiration.

803
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:00,903
Asking me is easier than asking Google.

804
00:51:01,231 --> 00:51:02,205
Here’s a tip.

805
00:51:02,448 --> 00:51:07,016
An interesting audition clip is judged by who you really are.

806
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,002
Cook the food you're best at.

807
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:11,512
No need to be too stunning or perfect.

808
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,980
Be natural, be yourself.

809
00:51:14,296 --> 00:51:17,985
Just think that you're cooking for the person you love the most.

810
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:20,506
That’s how you bring out your charms.

811
00:51:20,764 --> 00:51:24,604
Yeah. I shouldn’t have followed that first 5-sec captivation of yours, Dy.

812
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:27,010
Damn you. My head is itching all over.

813
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:28,874
We can just start over and reshoot.

814
00:51:28,882 --> 00:51:31,106
Let’s go buy everything and do it all over.

815
00:51:31,385 --> 00:51:32,831
Starting over and reshooting?

816
00:51:32,844 --> 00:51:33,979
That’s easy for you to say.

817
00:51:34,026 --> 00:51:35,979
You don’t need to wear this many layers like me.

818
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,543
I’ll list the stuff we need and go out to get them.

819
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:39,623
It’ll save us time.

820
00:51:42,189 --> 00:51:44,407
I’ll go help Prem then.

821
00:51:58,435 --> 00:52:00,605
Doc, are you still here?

822
00:52:01,022 --> 00:52:02,405
I was just about to leave.

823
00:52:03,228 --> 00:52:04,903
Then I saw him parking.

824
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:07,982
I was trying to figure out if he's here for you.

825
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:10,508
Can’t help but wonder.

826
00:52:11,346 --> 00:52:14,709
He’s here to help with the audition clip.

827
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,802
Why can he stay, and I can’t?

828
00:52:16,994 --> 00:52:18,616
It’s not the same.

829
00:52:18,632 --> 00:52:20,321
“Not the same” how? I don’t get it.

830
00:52:21,127 --> 00:52:22,321
I have experience.

831
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:24,805
I’ve been the show’s champion over 220 times.

832
00:52:25,404 --> 00:52:26,711
I can assist Prem.

833
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,106
Why are you here?

834
00:52:29,235 --> 00:52:30,602
Because I am…

835
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,056
his supporter.

836
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:41,703
Hi, Dr. Ten.

837
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:42,711
Hi.

838
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:43,807
Hello.

839
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,201
Are you here to see Prem?

840
00:52:46,357 --> 00:52:49,013
Sorry, he’s busy today. We need to shoot our audition clip.

841
00:52:49,477 --> 00:52:50,908
Mind if I stay?

842
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,152
I want to observe and learn.

843
00:52:52,164 --> 00:52:53,608
I’ll make sure to keep quiet.

844
00:52:54,077 --> 00:52:56,294
They think I’ll become unfocused.

845
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,404
Sure, you’re welcome to stay.

846
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:00,401
Can he really stay?

847
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:02,321
You’ll call me out for not being able to focus again.

848
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:03,405
What's up with you?

849
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,008
Are you two a thing?

850
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,106
If not, then he can’t distract you.

851
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,602
Or actually, you are?

852
00:53:33,395 --> 00:53:37,979
I think your grandson and my son are secretly dating.

853
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:40,657
Well then I can officially hit on you now.

854
00:53:40,825 --> 00:53:43,500
If you like him, go for it. What’s there to be afraid of?

855
00:53:43,751 --> 00:53:45,976
Don’t deny your own feelings.

856
00:53:46,204 --> 00:53:48,210
I want to have you by my side, Dynamite.

857
00:53:50,037 --> 00:53:54,401
I’m going to prove that what we have is not useless.
